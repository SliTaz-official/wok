  * CGI support (.cgi files are executed)
  * search support in CGI files
  * logging (-l option) and loglevels (-v option)

Usage:

    geomyidae [-d] [-l logfile] [-v loglvl] [-b htdocs] [-p port] [-o sport]
        [-u user] [-g group] [-h host] [-i IP]

        -d           don't fork into background
        -l logfile   setting this will turn on logging into logfile
        -v loglevel  see below (default 7)
        -b htdocs    the htdocs root for serving files (default /var/gopher)
        -p port      set the port where geomyidae should listen on (default 70)
        -o sport     set the port that should be shown in the dir listings
        -u user      which user rights the serving children should get
        -g group     which group rights the serving children should get
        -i IP        IP which geomyidae should bind to
        -h host      host that should be used in the dir listings

Loglevels:

    0 - no logging
    1 - served plain files
    2 - dir listings

    8 - not found queries

    1 + 2 + 4 = 7 (files + dir listings + HTTP)

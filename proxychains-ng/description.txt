ProxyChains is a UNIX program, that hooks network-related libc functions
in DYNAMICALLY LINKED programs via a preloaded DLL (dlsym(), LD_PRELOAD)
and redirects the connections through SOCKS4a/5 or HTTP proxies.
It supports TCP only (no UDP/ICMP etc).

The way it works is basically a HACK; so it is possible that it doesn't
work with your program, especially when it's a script, or starts
numerous processes like background daemons or uses dlopen() to load
"modules" (bug in glibc dynlinker).
It should work with simple compiled (C/C++) dynamically linked programs
though.

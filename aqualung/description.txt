Aqualung is a music player for the GNU/Linux operating system. It plays audio 
files from your filesystem and has the feature of inserting no gaps between 
adjacent tracks. It also supports high quality sample rate conversion between 
the file and the output device, when necessary.

Almost all sample-based, uncompressed formats (e.g. WAV, AIFF, AU etc.) are 
supported. Files encoded with FLAC (the Free Lossless Audio Codec), Ogg 
Vorbis, Ogg Speex, MPEG Audio (including the infamous MP3 format) and MOD 
audio formats (MOD, S3M, XM, IT, etc.), Musepack are also supported.

The program can play the music through OSS, ALSA or using the JACK Audio 
Connection Kit.

Enchant is a library (and command-line program) that wraps a number of
different spelling libraries and programs with a consistent interface.
By using Enchant, you can use a wide range of spelling libraries,
including some specialised for particular languages, without needing to
program to each library's interface. If it's not convenient to call a
C library, you can access most of Enchant's functionality via the enchant
program, which communicates over a pipe, like ispell, and is indeed
ispell-compatible.

I can't cope with icon theming in pure Qt environment
(see $src/src/iconloader/qticonloader.cpp).
So I just added all default icons to the application's resources.
All icons from Faenza icon theme.

Faenza is designed and developed by Matthieu James <matthieu.james@gmail.com>.
Faenza icons are all licensed under the GPL.

dar is a shell command that backs up from a single file to a whole filesystems,
taking care of hard links, Extended Attributes, sparse files, MacOS's file forks,
any inode type (including Solaris Door inodes), etc.
It has been tested under Linux, Windows, Solaris, FreeBSD, NetBSD, MacOS X and
several other systems and is released under the GNU General Public License (GPL).
It relies on the libdar library and its APplication Interface (API), which is the
core part of dar programs; as such, this library is released under the GPL along
with dar.
Consequently, to use the API, your program must be released under the GPL as well.
Some external programs do rely directly on libdar or on the dar command-line tool
to provide Graphical User Interfaces (GUI).

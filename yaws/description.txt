Yaws is a HTTP high perfomance 1.1 webserver particularly well suited for 
dynamic-content web applications. Two separate modes of operations are 
supported:

    Standalone mode where Yaws runs as a regular webserver daemon. This is the default mode.
    
    Embedded mode where Yaws runs as an embedded webserver in another Erlang application.
        
Yaws is entirely written in Erlang, and furthermore it is a multithreaded 
webserver where one Erlang lightweight process is used to handle each client.

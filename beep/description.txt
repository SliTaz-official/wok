I just got so tired of being limited to printf("\a"); when I wanted a terminal
beep.  This program isn't supposed to be anything stupendous, it's just
supposed to get the job done.  Its intended purpose in life is to live inside
shell/perl scripts, and allow a little more granularity than you get with the
default terminal bell.  Maybe I'm the only one who thinks this is useful. :)

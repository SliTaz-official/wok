**Avant Window Navgator** (Awn) is a dock-like bar which sits at the bottom of 
the screen (in all its composited-goodness) tracking open windows.

Awn uses libwnck to keep a track of open windows, and behaves exactly like a 
normal window-list : * Clicking an icon switches to that window, clicking 
again will minimise the window * Right-clicking will bring up a menu exactly 
like that of what you see on the window-list, allowing you to max, min, close, 
resize etc the window. * Dragging something on top of an icon will activate 
that window. * Visually (and quite attractively) responds to 'needs attention' 
& 'urgent' events * Can show windows from the entire viewport, or just the 
visible viewport.

The bar can be customised extensively: * Choose between two 'engines': * Glass 
engine. All the gradients can be changed to your tastes. * Pattern engine. 
That's right, you can now have a leopard print bar to match your underpants. 
* The border & internal border colours can be changed. * The 'glow' (the 
background of an active window icon) can be changed, to be as simple or as 
lavish as you require. * Choose between sharp or rounded corners. * Choose 
the text & shadow colour of the window title text.

All preferences can be adjusted using the provided avant-preferences program, 
which provides a friendly interface to the gconf settings.

This is the GNU gettext package. It is interesting for authors or maintainers of
other packages or programs which they want to see internationalized. As one step
the handling of messages in different languages should be implemented. For this
task GNU gettext provides the needed tools and library functions.

It is also interesting for translators, because GNU gettext provides the
'msgmerge' program, which prepares a message catalog before a translation
update.

Users of GNU packages should also install GNU gettext because some other GNU
packages will use the gettext program included in this package to
internationalize the messages given by shell scripts.

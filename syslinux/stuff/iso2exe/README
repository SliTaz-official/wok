The iso2exe tool inserts a DOS/WIN32 .EXE header in an ISO image.
The ISO image can be launched by DOS or Windows :

C:\> ren slitaz-5.0.iso slitaz.exe
C:\> slitaz


Why ?

According to the SliTaz forum, some new users have problems burning CD-ROMs,
creating USB Keys and booting these devices with the BIOS. Others are lost
during the installation process or partitioning.

The slitaz.exe program boots the SliTaz ISO image with a text menu:

- to start SliTaz in RAM (live) in graphics mode or text mode.

- to install SliTaz "a la UMSDOS" in the \slitaz\ subdirectory. The easiest
  way to install SliTaz. No partitioning. No questions. But (very) slow.

- to create a SliTaz USB Key.

When the slitaz.exe program can't boot SliTaz directly it will prompt to create
a bootable image on a removeable media (Memory card, USB stick or ... floppy).

Usage:

  C:\> progname [mode]

Default mode is menu. Mode can be:

- menu	 	start with an interactive menu
- live	 	launch SliTaz in RAM with graphics
- text	 	launch SliTaz in RAM with text mode
- install	SliTaz UMSDOS like installation

If the prognam name includes one of the supported modes, the according mode is
assumed. Example 'C:\> slitazlive.exe' starts SliTaz in RAM with graphics.


Implementation:

ISO9660 format begins with 32Kb unused (16 sectors). Some programs may use it:

- isolinux uses the first 512 bytes for hybrid iso boot (ISO image in a 
  partition).
- tazlito stores extra flavor info at the 2nd Kb for 'tazlito iso2flavor'.

The iso2exe tool moves the isolinux boot sector, installs its own boot sector 
with a DOS .EXE header, and adds a WIN32 .EXE installer, a DOS .COM Linux
loader and an initramfs in the end of the first 32Kb.

    +-----------------+
    |    untouched    | ISO9660 files including /boot/bzImage and /boot/rootfs*
32K +-----------------+
    |  DOS .EXE stub  | Start DOS .COM loader
    +-----------------+
    |  ISO initramfs  | Live loader and UMSDOS like install script
    +-----------------+
    | DOS .COM loader | Load bzImage, the last rootfs*.gz and the ISO initramfs
    +-----------------+
    | floppy bootstrap| CD-ROM emulation boot driver for hard disk ISO image
    +-----------------+
           unused
    +-----------------+
    |  tazlito info   | Flavor missing data for 'tazlito iso2flavor'
    +-----------------+
    | isohybrid boot  | Starts isolinux.bin
    +-----------------+
    |  iso2exe boot + | Boot starts isohybrid (*), .EXE starts DOS .COM loader
    |  WIN32 PE .exe  | NT+ boot device creator / Win9x DOS .COM launcher.
  0 +-----------------+ 

* Eltorito boot (i.e. bootable CD-ROM by BIOS) is not concerned by iso2exe.


Limitations:

- Only DOS 3 to 7 boot supported. Checked with http://www.allbootdisks.com/
  NT/XP support via boot device creation.

- Real mode support only. VM86 is not supported. Will not boot directly, but
  a removable boot media is created.

- The DOS Linux loader and the ISO initramfs must fit in ~30Kb.

- Linux kernels before version 2.6.30 don't support multiple initramfs load.
  They will not find the /init.exe file. The "text" mode will be forced:
	C:\> slitaz.exe text

- The ISO image must include the files /boot/bzImage and /boot/rootfs*.

TODO:

- Add XMM and VCPI (VM86) support.

- floppy bootstrap

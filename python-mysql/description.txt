MySQLdb is an interface to the popular MySQL database server for Python.
The design goals are:

- Compliance with Python database API version 2.0 [PEP-0249]
- Thread-safety
- Thread-friendliness (threads will not block each other)

MySQL-3.23 through 5.5 and Python-2.4 through 2.7 are currently supported.

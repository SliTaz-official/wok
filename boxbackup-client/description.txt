BoxBackup Client (bbackupd)

BoxBackup is designed to be easy to set up and run, and cheap to use. 
Once set up, there should be no need for user or administrative 
intervention, apart from usual system maintenance.

bbackupd is configured with a list of directories to back up. It has a 
lazy approach to backing up data. Every so often, the directories are 
scanned, and new data is uploaded to the server. 

The daemon is always running, although sleeping most of the time. In 
lazy mode, it is completely self contained - scripts running under cron 
jobs are not used.

If an old version of the file is present on the server, a modified 
version of the rsync algorithm is used to upload only the changed 
portions of the file.

After a new version is uploaded, the old version is still available 
(subject to disc space on the server). Similarly, a deleted file is 
still available. The only limit to their availability is space allocated 
to this account on the server.

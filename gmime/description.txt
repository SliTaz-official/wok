GMime is a C/C++ library which may be used for the creation
and parsing of messages using the Multipurpose Internet Mail
Extension (MIME) as defined by numerous IETF specifications.

GMime features an extremely robust high-performance parser
designed to be able to preserve byte-for-byte information
allowing developers to re-seralize the parsed messages back
to a stream exactly as the parser found them.
It also features integrated GnuPG and S/MIME v3.2 support.

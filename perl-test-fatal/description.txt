Test::Fatal is an alternative to the popular Test::Exception.
It does much less, but should allow greater flexibility in testing
exception-throwing code with about the same amount of typing.

It exports one routine by default: exception.

Attention!
exception intentionally does not manipulate the call stack.
User-written test functions that use exception must be careful to
avoid false positives if exceptions use stack traces that show
arguments.
For a more magical approach involving globally overriding caller,
see Test::Exception.

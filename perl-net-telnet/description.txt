Net::Telnet allows you to make client connections to a TCP port and do
network I/O, especially to a port using the TELNET protocol.
Simple I/O methods such as print, get, and getline are provided.
More sophisticated interactive features are provided because connecting
to a TELNET port ultimately means communicating with a program designed
for human interaction.
These interactive features include the ability to specify a time-out and
to wait for patterns to appear in the input stream, such as the prompt
from a shell.
IPv6 support is available when using perl 5.14 or later, see family().

Other reasons to use this module than strictly with a TELNET port are:

- You're not familiar with sockets and you want a simple way to make
  client connections to TCP services.
- You want to be able to specify your own time-out while connecting,
  reading, or writing.
- You're communicating with an interactive program at the other end of
  some socket or pipe and you want to wait for certain patterns to appear.

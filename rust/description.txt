Rust is a multi-paradigm, general-purpose programming language
designed for performance and safety, especially safe concurrency.
Rust is syntactically similar to C++, but can guarantee memory
safety by using a borrow checker to validate references.
Rust achieves memory safety without garbage collection, and
reference counting is optional.
Rust has been called a systems programming language and in
addition to high-level features such as functional programming
it also offers mechanisms for low-level memory management.

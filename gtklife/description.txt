GtkLife is a fast, featureful, open-source Conway's Life program.

Conway's Life is a form of artificial life (specifically, a cellular automaton)-
one of the simplest there is. There are only a few rules:

1. The game is played on a rectangular grid, where each cell is either alive or
   dead.
2. Each generation is computed from the state of the previous generation, using
   rules 3 and 4:
3. A live cell with 2 or 3 live neighbors (adjacent cells, including diagonals)
   lives on. Otherwise it dies.
4. A dead cell with exactly 3 live neighbors comes to life.

That's all there is to it. Yet fascinating behavior arises from these simple
rules.

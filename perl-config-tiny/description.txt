Config::Tiny is a Perl class to read and write .ini style
configuration files with as little code as possible,
reducing load time and memory overhead.

Most of the time it is accepted that Perl applications use
a lot of memory and modules.

The *::Tiny family of modules is specifically intended to
provide an ultralight alternative to the standard modules.

This module is primarily for reading human written files,
and anything we write shouldn't need to have documentation
or comments.
If you need something with more power move up to Config::Simple,
Config::General or one of the many other Config::* modules.

Lastly, Config::Tiny does not preserve your comments,
whitespace, or the order of your config file.

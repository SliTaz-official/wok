Outguess is a universal steganographic tool that allows
the insertion of hidden information into the redundant
bits of data sources.
The nature of the data source is irrelevant to the core
of outguess. The program relies on data specific handlers
that will extract redundant bits and write them back
after modification.
Currently only the PPM (Portable Pixel Map), PNM
(Portable Any Map), and JPEG image formats are supported,
although outguess could use any kind of data, as long as
a handler were provided.

Steganography is the art and science of hiding that
communication is happening.
Classical steganography systems depend on keeping the
encoding system secret, but modern steganography are
detectable only if secret information is known, e.g. a
secret key.
Because of their invasive nature steganography systems
leave detectable traces within a medium's characteristics.
This allows an eavesdropper to detect media that has been
modified, revealing that secret communication is taking
place. Although the secrecy of the information is not
degraded, its hidden nature is revealed, defeating the
main purpose of Steganography.

For JPEG images, OutGuess preserves statistics based on
frequency counts.
As a result, no known statistical test is able to detect
the presence of steganographic content.
Before embedding data into an image, the OutGuess system
can determine the maximum message size that can be hidden
while still being able to maintain statistics based on
frequency counts.

OutGuess uses a generic iterator object to select which
bits in the data should be modified.
A seed can be used to modify the behavior of the iterator.
It is embedded in the data along with the rest of the
message. By altering the seed, OutGuess tries to find a
sequence of bits that minimizes the number of changes in
the data that have to be made.

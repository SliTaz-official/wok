The original Comix Cursors.

X11 mouse theme with a comics feeling.
The package comes with 12 different mouse themes for X11.
6 colors (black, blue, green, orange, red and white)
2 different weights (slim and normal)

From version 0.8 on the cursors are 'multisize', meaning that you don't need to
install one theme for each size, but only one theme, and chose the size in the
cursor theme selection dialog.

The full installation also includes left-handed themes, you can choose whatever
you prefer from the downloads below.


The cursors are named according to the freedesktop.org cursor naming convention,
compatibility and hash cursor names are linked. In addition to the original
cursor pack left-handed and opaque versions are still available here.

ComixCursors come in sizes 32, 40, 48 and 64.

FLAC stands for Free Lossless Audio Codec, an audio format similar
to MP3, but lossless, meaning that audio is compressed in FLAC
without any loss in quality.
This is similar to how Zip works, except with FLAC you will get
much better compression because it is designed specifically for
audio, and you can play back compressed FLAC files in your favorite
player (or your car or home stereo, see supported devices) just
like you would an MP3 file.

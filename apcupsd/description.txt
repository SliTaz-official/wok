Apcupsd is a program for monitoring UPSes and performing a graceful computer 
shutdown in the event of a power failure. It runs on Linux, Mac OS/X, Win32, 
BSD, Solaris, and other OSes.

Apcupsd can be used for power mangement and controlling most of APC’s UPS 
models on Unix and Windows machines. Apcupsd works with most of APC’s 
Smart-UPS models as well as most simple signalling models such a Back-UPS, 
and BackUPS-Office. During a power failure, apcupsd will inform the users 
about the power failure and that a shutdown may occur. If power is not 
restored, a system shutdown will follow when the battery is exhausted, a 
timeout (seconds) expires, or runtime expires based on internal APC 
calculations determined by power consumption rates. Apcupsd is licensed under 
the GPL version 2.

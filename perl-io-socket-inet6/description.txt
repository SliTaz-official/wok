IO-Socket-INET6 was now succeeded by Paul Evans' IO::Socket::IP.
Please convert old code from IO-Socket-INET6 to IO-Socket-IP.

IO::Socket::INET6 provides an object interface to creating and using
sockets in either AF_INET or AF_INET6 domains.
It is built upon the IO::Socket interface and inherits all the methods
defined by IO::Socket.

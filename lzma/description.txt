The Lempel-Ziv Markov-chain Algorithm is a compression method based on the
famous LZ77 algorithm, and was first introduced by 7-Zip for use in 7z archives.

Its main characteristics are a very high compression ratio, with high RAM usage,
and fast decompression, with low RAM usage. These properties make it well suited
to embedded uses, such as for ROM (firmware) compression.

This package provides the lzma command line utility, which has a familiar
gzip-like interface.

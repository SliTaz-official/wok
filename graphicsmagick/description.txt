GraphicsMagick is the swiss army knife of image processing.
Comprised of 279K physical lines (according to David A. Wheeler's
SLOCCount) of source code in the base package (or 1,275K including
3rd party libraries) it provides a robust and efficient collection
of tools and libraries which support reading, writing, and
manipulating an image in over 89 major formats including important
formats like DPX, GIF, JPEG, JPEG-2000, PNG, PDF, PNM, TIFF, and WebP.

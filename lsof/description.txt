lsof is a command listing open files.
Open files in the system include disk files, named pipes, network sockets
and devices opened by all processes.
One use for this command is when a disk cannot be unmounted because
(unspecified) files are in use.
The listing of open files can be consulted (suitably filtered if necessary)
to identify the process that is using the files.

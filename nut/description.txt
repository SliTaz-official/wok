The primary goal of the Network UPS Tools (NUT) project is to provide
support for Power Devices, such as Uninterruptible Power Supplies,
Power Distribution Units, Automatic Transfer Switches, Power Supply
Units and Solar Controllers.
NUT provides a common protocol and set of tools to monitor and manage
such devices, and to consistently name equivalent features and data
points, across a vast range of vendor-specific protocols and connection
media types.

More than 170 different manufacturers, and several thousands of models
are compatible.

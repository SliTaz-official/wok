mtPaint is a painting program which Mark Tyler developed from scratch so he 
could easily create pixel art and manipulate digital photos.

It uses the GTK+ toolkit (version 1 or 2) and runs on PC's via the GNU/Linux or 
Windows operating systems. Due to its efficient design it can run on older PC 
hardware (e.g. a 200MHz CPU and 16MB of free RAM).

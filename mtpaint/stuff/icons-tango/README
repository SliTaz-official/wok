This directory contains icons and mouse pointers that are compiled into
mtPaint.  It is possible to create custom icon sets to suit personal taste.
For example in order to create and build a new set try:

 1) cp -r icons1 icons-new
 2) Edit the icons and pointers in icons-new as required
 3) ./configure icons-new
 4) make

This set of icons was modified for the needs of SliTaz GNU/Linux, we used
the one from the Tango projet and converted them to XPM format.

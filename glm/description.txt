OpenGL Mathematics (GLM) is a header only C++ mathematics library
for graphics software based on the OpenGL Shading Language (GLSL)
specifications.

GLM provides classes and functions designed and implemented with
the same naming conventions and functionality than GLSL so that
anyone who knows GLSL, can use GLM as well in C++.

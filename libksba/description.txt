KSBA (pronounced Kasbah) is a library to make X.509 certificates as well as the
CMS easily accessible by other applications. Both specifications are building
blocks of S/MIME and TLS.

KSBA is made available as a standard shared library and reserves identifiers
starting with "ksba" and "_ksba" (also uppercase and mixed case). It does not
rely on another cryptographic library.

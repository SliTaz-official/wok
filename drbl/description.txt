DRBL (Diskless Remote Boot in Linux) is free software, open source solution
to managing the deployment of the GNU/Linux operating system across many
clients. Imagine the time required to install GNU/Linux on 40, 30, or even 10
client machines individually! DRBL allows for the configuration all of your
client computers by installing just one server (remember, not just any virtual
private server) machine.

DRBL provides a diskless or systemless environment for client machines. It works
on Debian, Ubuntu, Red Hat, Fedora, CentOS and SuSE. DRBL uses distributed
hardware resources and makes it possible for clients to fully access local
hardware. It also includes Clonezilla, a partitioning and disk cloning utility
similar to Symantec GhostÂ®.

The features of DRBL:
 * Peacefully coexists with other OS
 * Simply install DRBL on a single server and all your clients are taken care of
 * Save on hardware, budget, and maintenance fees

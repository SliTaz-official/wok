Libqrencode is a fast and compact library for encoding data in a QR Code symbol,
a 2D symbology that can be scanned by handy terminals such as a mobile phone
with CCD. The capacity of QR Code is up to 7000 digits or 4000 characters and
has high robustness.

Libqrencode accepts a string or a list of data chunks then encodes in a
QR Code symbol as a bitmap array.
While other QR Code applications generate an image file, using libqrencode
allows applications to render QR Code symbols from raw bitmap data directly.
This library also contains a command-line utility outputs QR Code images in
various formats.

Pekwm, a window manager written by Claes Nästén that was once
based on the aewm++ window manager, but has since evolved enough
that it no longer resembles aewm++ at all.
It also has an expanded feature-set, including window grouping
(similar to ion, pwm, or fluxbox), auto properties, Xinerama
support and keygrabber that supports keychains, and much more.

Here's a short list of some of the features included in pekwm:

- Possibility to group windows in a single frame
- Configurable keygrabber that supports keychains
- Configurable mouse actions
- Configurable root- and window-menus and keybindings for all menus
- Dynamic menus that regenerate on every view from a script output
- Multi-screen support both via RandR and Xinerama
- Configurable window placement
- Theming support with images, shaping and configurable buttons.
- Autoproperties (Automatic properties such as a window's sticky
  state, etc.)

GNU Midnight Commander is a visual file manager, licensed under
GNU General Public License and therefore qualifies as Free Software.
It's a feature rich full-screen text mode application that allows you
to copy, move and delete files and whole directory trees, search for
files and run commands in the subshell.
Internal viewer and editor are included.

Midnight Commander is based on versatile text interfaces, such as Ncurses
or S-Lang, which allows it to work on a regular console, inside an
X Window terminal, over SSH connections and all kinds of remote shells.

SQLite is a C-language library that implements a small,
fast, self-contained, high-reliability, full-featured,
SQL database engine.
SQLite is the most used database engine in the world.
SQLite is built into all mobile phones and most computers
and comes bundled inside countless other applications
that people use every day.

The SQLite file format is stable, cross-platform, and
backwards compatible and the developers pledge to keep
it that way through the year 2050.
SQLite database files are commonly used as containers to
transfer rich content between systems and as a long-term
archival format for data.
There are over 1 trillion (1e12) SQLite databases in
active use.

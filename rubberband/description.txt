Rubber Band Library is a high quality software library for
audio time-stretching and pitch-shifting.
It permits you to change the tempo and pitch of an audio stream
or recording dynamically and independently of one another.

Rubber Band Library is a C++ library intended for use by
developers creating their own application programs, but it does
also include a simple, free command-line utility program that
you can use for fixed adjustments to the speed and pitch of
existing audio files.

With this compiled into your kernel, Linux can use a remote server
as one of its block devices.
Every time the client computer wants to read /dev/nbd0, it will send
a request to the server via TCP, which will reply with the data
requested.
This can be used for stations with low disk space (or even diskless
- if you use an initrd) to borrow disk space from other computers.
Unlike NFS, it is possible to put any file system on it.
But (also unlike NFS), if someone has mounted NBD read and write,
you must assure that no one else will have it mounted.

Current state:
It currently works. Network block device is pretty stable.
It was originaly thought that it is impossible to swap over TCP;
this turned out not to be true.
However, to avoid deadlocks, you will need at least Linux 3.6.

It is possible to use NBD as the block device counterpart of FUSE,
to implement the block device's reads and writes in user space.
To make this easer, recent versions of NBD (3.10 and above)
implement NBD over a Unix Domain Socket, too.

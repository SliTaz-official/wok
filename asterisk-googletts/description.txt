AGI script for the Asterisk open source PBX which allows you to use Googles' 
voice synthesis engine to render text to speech.

This script makes use of Google's translate text to speech service in order 
to render text to speech and play it back to the user. It supports a variety 
of different languages (See README for a complete list), local caching of the 
voice data and also supports 8kHz or 16kHz sample rates to provide the best 
possible sound quality along with the use of wideband codecs.

This TTS service is 'unofficial' and not supported by Google, it can be 
terminated at any point with no warning. People looking for TTS solutions to 
base their projects/products on should look for alternative, officially 
supported services.

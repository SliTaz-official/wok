Fcron is a periodical command scheduler which aims at replacing
Vixie Cron, so it implements most of its functionalities.

But fcron makes no assumptions on whether your system is running
all the time or regularly: you can, for instance, tell fcron to
execute tasks every x hours y minutes of system up time or to do
a job only once in a specified interval of time.

Fcron has also much more functionalities: you can also set a nice
value to a job, run it depending on the system load average and
much more!

Rlwrap is a 'readline wrapper', a small utility that uses the GNU Readline
library to allow the editing of keyboard input for any command.

I couldn't find anything like it when I needed it, so I wrote this one back
in 1999. By now, there are (and, in hindsight, even then there were) a number
of good readline wrappers around, like rlfe, distributed as part of the GNU
readline library, and the amazing socat.

You should consider using rlwrap especially when you need user-defined
completion (by way of completion word lists) and persistent history, or if
you want to program 'special effects' using the filter mechanism.

FLTK (pronounced "fulltick") is a cross-platform C++ GUI toolkit
for UNIX/Linux (X11), Microsoft Windows, and MacOS X.
FLTK provides modern GUI functionality without the bloat and
supports 3D graphics via OpenGL and its built-in GLUT emulation.

This package provides Fluid, an interactive GUI designer for FLTK,
allowing graphical development of FLTK-based user interfaces.
It natively works with (textual) ".fl" files, but also includes
rough support for reading ".fd" files produced by fdesign.

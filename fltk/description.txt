FLTK (pronounced "fulltick") is a cross-platform C++ GUI toolkit for UNIX/Linux 
(X11), Microsoft Windows, and MacOS X. FLTK provides modern GUI functionality 
without the bloat and supports 3D graphics via OpenGL and its built-in GLUT 
emulation.

This package provides Fluid, an interactive GUI designer for FLTK, allowing
graphical development of FLTK-based user interfaces. It natively works with
(textual) `.fl` files, but also includes rough support for reading `.fd` files
produced by fdesign.

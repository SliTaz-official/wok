ntpclient is an NTP ([RFC-1305](http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc1305.txt)) client
for unix-alike computers. Its functionality is a small subset of [xntpd]
(http://www.eecis.udel.edu/~mills/ntp/), but IMHO performs better (or at least
has the potential to function better) within that limited scope. Since it is
much smaller than xntpd, it is also more relevant for embedded computers.

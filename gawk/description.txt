If you are like many computer users, you would frequently like to make changes 
in various text files wherever certain patterns appear, or extract data from

in a language such as C or Pascal is a time-consuming inconvenience that may 
take many lines of code. The job is easy with awk, especially the GNU 
implementation: gawk.

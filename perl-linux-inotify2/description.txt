This module implements an interface to the Linux 2.6.13 and later
Inotify file or directory change notification system.

It has a number of advantages over the Linux::Inotify module:

- it is portable (Linux::Inotify only works on x86)
- the equivalent of fullname works correctly
- it is better documented
- it has callback-style interface, which is better suited for
  integration.

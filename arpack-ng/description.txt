ARPACK software is capable of solving large scale symmetric, nonsymmetric, 
and generalized eigenproblems from significant application areas. The 
software is designed to compute a few (k) eigenvalues with user specified 
features such as those of largest real part or largest magnitude. Storage 
requirements are on the order of n*k locations. No auxiliary storage is 
required. A set of Schur basis vectors for the desired k-dimensional 
eigen-space is computed which is numerically orthogonal to working precision. 
Numerically accurate eigenvectors are available on request.

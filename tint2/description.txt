tint2 is a simple panel/taskbar made for modern X window managers. It was
specifically made for Openbox but it should also work with other window managers
(GNOME, KDE, XFCE etc.). It is based on ttm <http://code.google.com/p/ttm/>.

Features
--------

  * Panel with taskbar, system tray, clock and launcher icons;
  * Easy to customize: color/transparency on fonts, icons, borders and
    backgrounds;
  * Pager like capability: move tasks between workspaces (virtual desktops),
    switch between workspaces;
  * Multi-monitor capability: create one panel per monitor, showing only the
    tasks from the current monitor;
  * Customizable mouse events.

Goals
-----

  * Be unintrusive and light (in terms of memory, CPU and aesthetic);
  * Follow the freedesktop.org specifications;
  * Make certain workflows, such as multi-desktop and multi-monitor, easy
    to use.

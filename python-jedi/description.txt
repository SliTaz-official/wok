Jedi is a static analysis tool for Python that is typically used in
IDEs and editors plugins.
Jedi has a focus on autocompletion and goto functionality.
Other features include refactoring, code search and finding references.

Jedi has a simple API to work with. There is a reference implementation
as a VIM-Plugin.
Autocompletion in your REPL is also possible, IPython uses it natively
and for the CPython REPL you can install it.
Jedi is well tested and bugs should be rare.

Jedi can currently be used with the following editors or projects:

- Vim (jedi-vim, YouCompleteMe, deoplete-jedi, completor.vim)
- Visual Studio Code (via Python Extension)
- Emacs (Jedi.el, company-mode, elpy, anaconda-mode, ycmd)
- Sublime Text (SublimeJEDI [ST2 + ST3], anaconda [only ST3])
- TextMate (Not sure if it\u2019s actually working)
- Kate version 4.13+ supports it natively, you have to enable it,
  though.
- Atom (autocomplete-python-jedi)
- GNOME Builder (with support for GObject Introspection)
- Gedit (gedi)
- wdb - Web Debugger
- Eric IDE (Available as a plugin)
- IPython 6.0.0+

and many more!

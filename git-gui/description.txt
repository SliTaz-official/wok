A Tcl/Tk based graphical user interface to Git.

git gui focuses on allowing users to make changes to their repository by making
new commits, amending existing ones, creating branches, performing local merges,
and fetching/pushing to remote repositories.

Unlike gitk, git gui focuses on commit generation and single file annotation and
does not show project history. It does however supply menu actions to start a
gitk session from within git gui.

git gui is known to work on all popular UNIX systems, Mac OS X, and Windows
(under both Cygwin and MSYS). To the extent possible OS specific user interface
guidelines are followed, making git gui a fairly native interface for users.

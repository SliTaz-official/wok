The shared-mime-info package contains the core database of common types and the
`update-mime-database` command used to extend it. This database is translated
at [Transifex](http://www.transifex.net/projects/p/shared-mime-info/).

See the [Shared MIME Info Specification]
(https://freedesktop.org/wiki/Specifications/shared-mime-info-spec/) for more

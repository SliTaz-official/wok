PPPoE (Point-to-Point Protocol over Ethernet) is a protocol used by many ADSL
Internet Service Providers. Roaring Penguin has a free client for Linux systems
to connect to PPPoE service providers.

The client is a user-mode program and does not require any kernel modifications.
It is fully compliant with RFC 2516, the official PPPoE specification.

afpfs-ng is a client for the Apple Filing Protocol (AFP) which will let you 
mount and access shared volumes from Mac OS X (or netatalk) to Linux, BSD and 
Mac OS X systems. There is a FUSE-based client which lets you mount a remote 
filesystem.  It is for Linux and FreeBSD.

There is also a simple, command-line AFP client; think about it as an FTP 
client for AFP.

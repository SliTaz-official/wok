Auto Adjust Photo tries to give a solution for the automatic color correction of 
photos. This means setting the contrast, color balance, saturation and gamma 
levels of the image by analization. 

This can be a solution for those kind of users who are not able to manage and 
correct images with complicated graphical softwares, or just simply don't 
intend to spend a lot of time with manually correcting the images one-by-one. 

The program handles the following image formats:
mif, pnm / pgm / ppm, bmp, ras, jp2, jpc, jpg, png

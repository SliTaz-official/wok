FluidSynth is a real-time software synthesizer based on the
SoundFont 2 specifications and has reached widespread distribution.
FluidSynth itself does not have a graphical user interface, but
due to its powerful API several applications utilize it and it has
even found its way onto embedded systems and is used in some mobile
applications.

Android SDK Platform-Tools is a component for the Android SDK. It includes 
tools that interface with the Android platform, such as adb, fastboot, and 
systrace. These tools are required for Android app development. They're also 
needed if you want to unlock your device bootloader and flash it with a new 
system image.

Although some new features in these tools are available only for recent 
versions of Android, the tools are backward compatible, so you need only one 
version of the SDK Platform-Tools.

If you're an app developer, you should get the latest version from Android 
Studio's SDK Manager or from the sdkmanager command-line tool. This ensures 
the tools are saved to the right place with the rest of your Android SDK 
tools and easily updated.

Compress-Raw-Bzip2 provides an interface to the in-memory
compression and uncompression functions from the bzip2
compression library.

Although the primary purpose for the existence of
Compress::Raw::Bzip2 is for use by the IO::Compress::Bzip2
and IO::Compress::Bunzip2 modules, it can be used on its
own for simple compression and uncompression tasks.

GNU SASL is an implementation of the Simple Authentication and
Security Layer framework and a few common SASL mechanisms.
SASL is used by network servers (e.g., IMAP, SMTP, XMPP) to
request authentication from clients, and in clients to
authenticate against servers.

GNU SASL consists of a C library (libgsasl), a command-line
application (gsasl), and a manual.
The library supports the ANONYMOUS, CRAM-MD5, DIGEST-MD5,
EXTERNAL, GS2-KRB5, GSSAPI, LOGIN, NTLM, OPENID20, PLAIN,
SCRAM-SHA-1, SCRAM-SHA-1-PLUS, SCRAM-SHA-256, SCRAM-SHA-256-PLUS,
SAML20, and SECURID mechanisms.

The library is portable because it does not do network
communication by itself, but rather leaves it up to the calling
application.
The library is flexible with regards to the authorization
infrastructure used, as it utilizes callbacks into the application
to decide whether an user is authorized or not.

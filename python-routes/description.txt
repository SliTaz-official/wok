Routes is a Python re-implementation of the Rails routes system for mapping
URLs to Controllers/Actions and generating URLs.
Routes makes it easy to create pretty and concise URLs that are RESTful with
little effort.

Speedy and dynamic URL generation means you get a URL with minimal cruft
(no big dangling query args).
Shortcut features like Named Routes cut down on repetitive typing.

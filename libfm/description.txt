LibFM provides file management functions built on top of Glib/GIO, giving
a convenient higher-level API.

Some features:
  * Desktop-independent, following FreeDesktop standards;
  * Fast, light on memory usage, and responsive - well suited to less powerful
    hardware such as netbooks and thin clients;
  * Uses GIO/GVFS (like Nautilus) for Trash support and access to remote file
    systems (FTP, SFTP, WebDAV, Windows shares, etc.);
  * Clipboard operations are compatible with GTK+/GNOME and Qt/KDE;
  * Supports both Drag-and-Drop, and the X Direct Save protocol;
  * Reusable design with the core functions separated out to simplify porting
    to other GUIs.

This package contains the core library.

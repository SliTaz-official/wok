Libnids is a library that provides a functionality of one of NIDS 
(Network Intrusion Detection System) components, namely E-component.
It means that libnids code watches all local network traffic, cooks
received datagrams a bit (quite a bit ;)), and provides convenient
information on them to analyzing modules of NIDS.

Libnids performs:
a) assembly of TCP segments into TCP streams
b) IP defragmentation
c) TCP port scan detection

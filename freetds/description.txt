FreeTDS is a set of libraries for Unix and Linux that allows
your programs to natively talk to Microsoft SQL Server and
Sybase databases.

Technically speaking, FreeTDS is an open source implementation
of the TDS (Tabular Data Stream) protocol used by these
databases for their own clients.
It supports many different flavors of the protocol and three
APIs to access it.
Additionally FreeTDS works with other software such as Perl
and PHP, providing access from those languages as well.

The Digest::MD5 module allows you to use the RSA Data Security Inc.
MD5 Message Digest algorithm from within Perl programs.
The algorithm takes as input a message of arbitrary length and
produces as output a 128-bit "fingerprint" or "message digest"
of the input.

Note that the MD5 algorithm is not as strong as it used to be.
It has since 2005 been easy to generate different messages that
produce the same MD5 digest.
It still seems hard to generate messages that produce a given digest,
but it is probably wise to move to stronger algorithms for applications
that depend on the digest to uniquely identify a message.

The Digest::MD5 module provides a procedural interface for simple use,
as well as an object oriented interface that can handle messages of
arbitrary length and which can read files directly.

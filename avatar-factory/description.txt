Avatar Factory is a bash script that creates shortcuts (Desktop Entry files)
with eye candy icons that represent music albums, photo albums, DVD films,
youtube videos, and more. When clicked the avatars can perform different
actions as launching a video, start playing some music (compatible with many
music players), open a folder, etc...
They can be viewed in Nautilus, Thunar or any application that support Desktop
Entry files.

Libjpeg-turbo is a JPEG image codec that uses SIMD instructions
(MMX, SSE2, AVX2, Neon, AltiVec) to accelerate baseline JPEG
compression and decompression on x86, x86-64, Arm, and PowerPC
systems, as well as progressive JPEG compression on x86 and
x86-64 systems.
On such systems, libjpeg-turbo is generally 2-6x as fast as
libjpeg, all else being equal.
On other types of systems, libjpeg-turbo can still outperform
libjpeg by a significant amount, by virtue of its highly-optimized
Huffman coding routines. In many cases, the performance of
libjpeg-turbo rivals that of proprietary high-speed JPEG codecs.

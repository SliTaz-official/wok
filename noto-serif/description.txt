Beautiful and free fonts for all languages

When text is rendered by a computer, sometimes characters are displayed as
“tofu”. They are little boxes to indicate your device doesn’t have a font to
display the text.

Google has been developing a font family called Noto, which aims to support all
languages with a harmonious look and feel. Noto is Google’s answer to tofu. The
name noto is to convey the idea that Google’s goal is to see “**no** more
**to**fu”. Noto has multiple styles and weights, and freely available to all.
The comprehensive set of fonts and tools used in our development are available
in our [GitHub repositories](https://github.com/googlei18n?query=noto).

All Noto fonts are now licensed under OFL.

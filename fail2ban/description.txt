Fail2ban scans log files (e.g. /var/log/apache/error_log) and
bans IPs that show the malicious signs -- too many password
failures, seeking for exploits, etc.
Generally Fail2Ban is then used to update firewall rules to
reject the IP addresses for a specified amount of time,
although any arbitrary other action (e.g. sending an email)
could also be configured.
Out of the box Fail2Ban comes with filters for various services
(apache, courier, ssh, etc).

Fail2Ban is able to reduce the rate of incorrect authentications
attempts however it cannot eliminate the risk that weak
authentication presents.
Configure services to use only two factor or public/private
authentication mechanisms if you really want to protect services.

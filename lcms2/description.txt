Little CMS intends to be an OPEN SOURCE small-footprint color management
engine, with special focus on accuracy and performance. It uses the
International Color Consortium standard (ICC), which is the modern standard
when regarding to color management. The ICC specification is widely used and is
referred to in many International and other de-facto standards. It was approved
as an International Standard, ISO 15076-1, in 2005.

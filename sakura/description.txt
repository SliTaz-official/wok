Sakura is a terminal emulator based just on GTK and VTE. It's a terminal
emulator with few dependencies, so you don't need a full GNOME desktop
installed to have a decent terminal emulator. Some of the terminal emulators
based on VTE are gnome-terminal, XFCE Terminal, TermIt, etc. Sakura just uses
a notebook to provide several terminals in one window and adds a contextual
menu with some basic options. No more no less.

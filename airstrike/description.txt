Airstrike is a 2d dogfighting game being slowly developed by various people 
around the net. It is not yet playable although there is an old version which 
may be a bit fun to try. We are developing the game using only freely 
available tools, and we try to do everything ourselves. The source code and 
the 3d models are released under the GPL licence.

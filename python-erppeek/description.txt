The ERPpeek library communicates with any Odoo / OpenERP server (>= 5.0)
using the standard XML-RPC interface or the new JSON-RPC interface.

It provides both a fully featured low-level API, and an encapsulation of
the methods on Active Record objects.
Additional helpers are provided to explore the model and administrate
the server remotely.

FFTW is a C subroutine library for computing the discrete
Fourier transform (DFT) in one or more dimensions,
of arbitrary input size, and of both real and complex data
(as well as of even or odd data, i.e. the discrete cosine
or sine transforms or DCT/DST).
We believe that FFTW, which is free software, should become
the FFT library of choice for most applications.

Have you ever thought that Tetris is evil because it never sends you that 
straight "I" brick you need to clear four rows? Well, Tetris(R) probably is not 
so malevolent, but Bastet certainly is. >:->

Bastet stands for "bastard tetris", and is a simple ncurses-based Tetris(R) 
clone for Linux. Instead of choosing the next block randomly, this fiendish 
program uses a special algorithm to give you the worst possible brick. Playing 
Bastet can be a very frustrating experience!

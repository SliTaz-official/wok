The ncurses (new curses) library is a free software emulation
of curses in System V Release 4.0 (SVr4), and more.
It uses terminfo format, supports pads and color and multiple
highlights and forms characters and function-key mapping, and
has all the other SVr4-curses enhancements over BSD curses.
SVr4 curses became the basis of X/Open Curses.

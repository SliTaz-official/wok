IO::Tty is used internally by IO::Pty to create a pseudo-tty.
You wouldn't want to use it directly except to import constants,
use IO::Pty.
For a list of importable constants, see IO::Tty::Constant.

Please note that pty creation is very system-dependend.
From my experience, any modern POSIX system should be fine.

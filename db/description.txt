Berkeley DB enables the development of custom data management solutions, without
the overhead traditionally associated with such custom projects. Berkeley DB 
provides a collection of well-proven building-block technologies that can be 
configured to address any application need from the hand-held device to the 
datacenter, from a local storage solution to a world-wide distributed one, from 
kilobytes to petabytes.

Mini-XML is a tiny XML library that you can use to read and write XML
and XML-like data files in your application without requiring large
non-standard libraries.
Mini-XML only requires an ANSI C compatible compiler (GCC works, as do
most vendors' ANSI C compilers) and a make program.

Mini-XML provides the following functionality:

- Reading of UTF-8 and UTF-16 and writing of UTF-8 encoded XML files
  and strings.
- Data is stored in a linked-list tree structure, preserving the XML
  data hierarchy.
- SAX (streamed) reading of XML files and strings to minimize memory
  usage.
- Supports arbitrary element names, attributes, and attribute values
  with no preset limits, just available memory.
- Supports integer, real, opaque ("cdata"), and text data types in
  "leaf" nodes.
- Functions for creating and managing trees of data.
- "Find" and "walk" functions for easily locating and navigating trees
  of data.

Mini-XML doesn't do validation or other types of processing on the
data based upon schema files or other sources of definition information.

This module implements some sane defaults for Perl programs,
as defined by two typical (or not so typical - use your
common sense) specimens of Perl coders.
In fact, after working out details on which warnings and
strict modes to enable and make fatal, we found that we
(and our code written so far, and others) fully agree on
every option, even though we never used warnings before,
so it seems this module indeed reflects a "common" sense
among some long-time Perl coders.

The basic philosophy behind the choices made in common::sense
can be summarised as: "enforcing strict policies to catch as
many bugs as possible, while at the same time, not limiting
the expressive power available to the programmer".

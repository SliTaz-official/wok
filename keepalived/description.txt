The main goal of this project is to provide simple and robust facilities
for loadbalancing and high-availability to Linux system and Linux based
infrastructures. Loadbalancing framework relies on well-known and widely
used Linux Virtual Server (IPVS) kernel module providing Layer4 loadbalancing.
Keepalived implements a set of checkers to dynamically and adaptively maintain
and manage loadbalanced server pool according their health. On the other hand
high-availability is achieved by VRRP protocol. VRRP is a fundamental brick for
router failover. In addition, Keepalived implements a set of hooks to the VRRP
finite state machine providing low-level and high-speed protocol interactions.
In order to offer fastest network failure detection, Keepalived implements BFD
protocol. VRRP state transition can take into account BFD hint to drive fast
state transition. Keepalived frameworks can be used independently or all
together to provide resilient infrastructures.

Keepalived implementation is based on an I/O multiplexer to handle a
strong multi-threading framework. All the events process use this I/O
multiplexer.

ThinkPad laptops include a proprietary interface called SMAPI BIOS 
(System Management Application Program Interface) which provides some
hardware control functionality that is not accessible by other means.

tp_smapi is highly recommended if you're using a ThinkPad laptop.

Not all functions are available on all models; for detailed status, see:

WARNING: 
This driver uses undocumented features and direct hardware access.
It thus cannot be guaranteed to work, and may cause arbitrary damage
(especially on models it wasn't tested on).

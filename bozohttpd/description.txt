bozohttpd is a small and secure HTTP server. Its main feature is the lack
of features, reducing code size and improving verifiability. It has
no configuration file by design.

It supports CGI/1.1, HTTP/1.1, HTTP/1.0, HTTP/0.9, ~user translations, virtual
hosting support, as well as multiple IP-based servers on a single machine,
and is able to serve pages via the IPv6 protocol.

Wimlib is an open source, cross-platform library for creating, extracting,
and modifying Windows Imaging (WIM) archives.
WIM is a file archiving format, somewhat comparable to ZIP (and many other
file archiving formats); but unlike ZIP, it allows storing various
Windows-specific metadata, allows storing multiple "images" in a single
archive, automatically deduplicates all file contents, and supports
optional solid compression to get a better compression ratio.
Wimlib and its command-line frontend wimlib-imagex provide a free and
cross-platform alternative to Microsoft's WIMGAPI, ImageX, and DISM.

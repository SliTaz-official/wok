Exporter::Tiny supports many of Sub::Exporter's external-facing
features including renaming imported functions with the -as,
-prefix and -suffix options; explicit destinations with the into
option; and alternative installers with the installer option.
But it's written in only about 40% as many lines of code and with
zero non-core dependencies.

Its internal-facing interface is closer to Exporter.pm, with
configuration done through the @EXPORT, @EXPORT_OK and
%EXPORT_TAGS package variables.

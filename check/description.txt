Check is a unit testing framework for C.
It features a simple interface for defining unit tests, putting
little in the way of the developer.
Tests are run in a separate address space, so both assertion
failures and code errors that cause segmentation faults or other
signals can be caught.
Test results are reportable in the following:
Subunit, TAP, XML, and a generic logging format.

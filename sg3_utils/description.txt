The sg3_utils package contains utilities that send SCSI commands to devices.
As well as devices on transports traditionally associated with SCSI
(e.g. Fibre Channel (FCP), Serial Attached SCSI (SAS) and the SCSI
Parallel Interface(SPI)) many other devices use SCSI command sets.
ATAPI optical drives and SATA disks that connect via a translation layer
or a bridge device are examples of devices that use SCSI command sets.

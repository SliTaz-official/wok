Usage: scanimage [OPTION]...

Start image acquisition on a scanner device and write PNM image data to
standard output.

-d, --device-name=DEVICE   use a given scanner device (e.g. hp:/dev/scanner)
    --format=pnm|tiff      file format of output file
-i, --icc-profile=PROFILE  include this ICC profile into TIFF file
-L, --list-devices         show available scanner devices
-f, --formatted-device-list=FORMAT similar to -L, but the FORMAT of the output
                           can be specified: %d (device name), %v (vendor),
                           %m (model), %t (type), and %i (index number)
-b, --batch[=FORMAT]       working in batch mode, FORMAT is `out%d.pnm' or
                           `out%d.tif' by default depending on --format
    --batch-start=#        page number to start naming files with
    --batch-count=#        how many pages to scan in batch mode
    --batch-increment=#    increase number in filename by an amount of #
    --batch-double         increment page number by two for 2sided originals
                           being scanned in a single sided scanner
    --batch-prompt         ask for pressing a key before scanning a page
    --accept-md5-only      only accept authorization requests using md5
-n, --dont-scan            only set options, don't actually scan
-T, --test                 test backend thoroughly
-h, --help                 display this help message and exit
-v, --verbose              give even more status messages
-V, --version              print version information

Options specific to device `hpoj:mlc:usb:psc_1200_series':
  Scan mode:
    --mode Lineart|Grayscale|Color [Color]
        Selects the scan mode (e.g., lineart,monochrome, or color).
    --resolution 75..600dpi [75]
        Sets the resolution of the scanned image.
  Advanced:
    --contrast 0..100 [inactive]
        Controls the contrast of the acquired image.
    --compression None|JPEG [None]
        Selects the scanner compression method for faster scans, possibly at
        the expense of image quality.
    --jpeg-compression-factor 0..100 [inactive]
        Sets the scanner JPEG compression factor.  Larger numbers mean better
        compression, and smaller numbers mean better image quality.
    --batch-scan[=(yes|no)] [no]
        Guarantees that a "no documents" condition will be returned after the
        last scanned page, to prevent endless flatbed scans after a batch scan.
         For some models, option changes in the middle of a batch scan don't
        take effect until after the last page.
    --source Flatbed [Flatbed]
        Selects the desired scan source for models with both flatbed and
        automatic document feeder (ADF) capabilities.  The "Auto" setting means
        that the ADF will be used if it's loaded, and the flatbed (if present)
        will be used otherwise.
    --duplex[=(yes|no)] [inactive]
        Enables scanning on both sides of the page for models with
        duplex-capable document feeders.  For pages printed in "book"-style
        duplex mode, one side will be scanned upside-down.  This feature is
        experimental.
  Geometry:
    --length-measurement Unknown|Approximate|Padded [Padded]
        Selects how the scanned image length is measured and reported, which
        is impossible to know in advance for scrollfed scans.
    -l 0..215.9mm [0]
        Top-left x position of scan area.
    -t 0..296.926mm [0]
        Top-left y position of scan area.
    -x 0..215.9mm [215.9]
        Width of scan-area.
    -y 0..296.926mm [296.926]
        Height of scan-area.

BIND is open source software that enables you to publish your Domain Name 
System (DNS) information on the Internet, and to resolve DNS queries for your 
users. The name BIND stands for “Berkeley Internet Name Domain”, because the 
software originated in the early 1980s at the University of California at 
Berkeley.

BIND is by far the most widely used DNS software on the Internet, providing a 
robust and stable platform on top of which organizations can build 
distributed computing systems with the knowledge that those systems are fully 
compliant with published DNS standards.

The Time Zone Database (often called tz or zoneinfo) contains code and data
that represent the history of local time for many representative locations
around the globe. It is updated periodically to reflect changes made by
political bodies to time zone boundaries, UTC offsets, and daylight-saving
rules.

Historical local time information has been included here to:

  * provide a compendium of data about the history of civil time that is useful
    even if not 100% accurate;
  * give an idea of the variety of local time rules that have existed in the
    past and thus an idea of the variety that may be expected in the future;
  * provide a test of the generality of the local time rule description system.

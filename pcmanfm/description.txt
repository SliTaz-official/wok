PCMan File Manager (PCManFM) is a file manager application
developed by Hong Jen Yee from Taiwan which is meant to be
a replacement for Nautilus, Konqueror and Thunar.
PCManFM is the standard file manager in LXDE, which is also
developed by the same author in conjunction with other
developers.
Since 2010, PCManFM has undergone a complete rewrite from
scratch. So the new PCManFM is totally different from the
old 0.5.x series.
Build instructions, the ways to setup, and configuration
files are different, too.

PCManFM is intended to follow the specifications given by
Freedesktop.org for interoperability in free software.

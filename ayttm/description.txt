**Ayttm** is an instant messaging (aka chat) client that provides all-in-one 
chat functionality for several major instant messaging services from one 
simple program. Ayttm "Contacts" allow you to refer to several accounts of the 
same person from a single contact name, making it one of the cleanest and 
simplest clients to use.

Ayttm is the heir of the Everybuddy project, and aims to continue improving 
the program and addressing its shortcomings.

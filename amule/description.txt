aMule is an eMule-like client for the eD2k and Kademlia networks, supporting 
multiple platforms. aMule is entirely free, its sourcecode released under the 
GPL just like eMule, and includes no adware or spyware as is often found in 
proprietary P2P applications.

aMule is built upon the wxWidgets (formerly wxWindows) toolkit, which enables 
it to support multiple platforms.

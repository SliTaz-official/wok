Genext2fs generates an ext2 filesystem as a normal (non-root) user.
It does not require you to mount the image file to copy files on it,
nor does it require that you become the superuser to make device nodes.

The filesystem image is created in the file output-image.
If not specified, it is sent to stdout.
The -d and -a options support reading from stdin if a single hyphen
is given as an argument. Thus, genext2fs can be used as part of a
pipeline without any temporary files.

DEPRECATED!

Since Net::SMTP v1.28 (2014-10-08), Net::SMTP itself has support for SMTP
over SSL, and also for STARTTLS.
Use Net::SMTP, not Net::SMTP::SSL.


Implements the same API as Net::SMTP, but uses IO::Socket::SSL for its
network operations.
Due to the nature of Net::SMTP's new method, it is not overridden to
make use of a default port for the SMTPS service.
Perhaps future versions will be smart like that.
Port 465 is usually what you want, and it's not a pain to specify that.

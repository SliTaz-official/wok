Asterisk includes a set of standard sound files in various formats. The core 
part of that collection in US English, by voice actress Allison Smith, is 
contained in various encodings in packages asterisk-core-sounds-en-*; this 
package registers these through the alternatives system to provide the 
default "en" (English) and "en_US" (USA English) sounds.

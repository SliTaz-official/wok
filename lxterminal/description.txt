LXTerminal is a VTE-based terminal emulator for the Lightweight X11 Desktop
Environment (LXDE).

It supports multiple tabs and has only minimal dependencies thus being
completely desktop-independent. In order to reduce memory usage and increase
the performance, all instances of the terminal are sharing a single process.

This module provides a basic framework for creating and maintaining RDF
Site Summary (RSS) files.
This distribution also contains many examples that allow you to generate
HTML from an RSS, convert between 0.9, 0.91, 1.0, and 2.0 version, and
other nifty things.
This might be helpful if you want to include news feeds on your Web site
from sources like Slashdot and Freshmeat or if you want to syndicate
your own content.

XML::RSS currently supports versions 0.9, 0.91, 1.0, and 2.0 of RSS.

RSS was originally developed by Netscape as the format for Netscape
Netcenter channels, however, many Web sites have since adopted it as a
simple syndication format.
With the advent of RSS 1.0, users are now able to syndication many
different kinds of content including news headlines, threaded messages,
products catalogs, etc.

GNU Emacs is an extensible, customizable text editor and more. 
At its core is an interpreter for Emacs Lisp, a dialect of 
the Lisp programming language with extensions to support text 
editing and much more.

Emacs has been stripped down for SliTaz: POP mail, x-window,
games, sound, info, man pages, Lisp sources are not available.

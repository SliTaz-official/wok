Poedit - a cross-platform gettext catalogs editing tool

This program is GUI frontend to GNU gettext utilities and catalogs editor/source
code parser. It helps with translating application into another language. For
details on principles of the solution used, see GNU gettext documentation or
wxWidgets' wxLocale class reference.

Poedit is released under the MIT license and you're free to do whatever you want
with it and its source code (well, almost :-) -- see the license text).

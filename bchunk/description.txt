binchunker converts a CD image in a ".bin / .cue" format (sometimes ".raw / 
.cue") to a set of .iso and .cdr tracks. The bin/cue format is used by some 
popular non-Unix cd-writing software, but is not supported on most other CD 
burning programs. A lot of CD/VCD images distributed on the Internet are in 
BIN/CUE format, I've been told.

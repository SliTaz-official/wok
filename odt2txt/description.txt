odt2txt is a command-line tool which extracts the text out of OpenDocument Texts produced by OpenOffice.org, StarOffice, KOffice and others.

odt2txt can also extract text from some file formats similar to OpenDocument Text, such as OpenOffice.org XML (*.sxw), which was used by OpenOffice.org version 1.x and older StarOffice versions. To a lesser extent, odt2txt may be useful to extract content from OpenDocument spreadsheets (*.ods) and OpenDocument presentations (*.odp).

The Concurrent Versions System (CVS), also known as the Concurrent Versioning 
System, is a client-server free software revision control system in the field of
software development. Version control system software keeps track of all work 
and all changes in a set of files, and allows several developers (potentially 
widely separated in space and/or time) to collaborate.

In the never-ending quest for great taste with fewer calories,
we proudly present: MIME::Lite.

MIME::Lite is intended as a simple, standalone module for generating
(not parsing!) MIME messages... specifically, it allows you to output
a simple, decent single- or multi-part message with text or binary
attachments.
It does not require that you have the Mail:: or MIME:: modules installed,
but will work with them if they are.

You can specify each message part as either the literal data itself
(in a scalar or array), or as a string which can be given to open()
to get a readable filehandle (e.g., "<filename" or "somecommand|").

You don't need to worry about encoding your message data:
this module will do that for you.
It handles the 5 standard MIME encodings.

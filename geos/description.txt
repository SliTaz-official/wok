GEOS is a C/C++ library for spatial computational geometry of the sort
generally used by "geographic information systems" software.
It implements the OGC Simple Features geometry model and provides all
the spatial functions in that standard as well as many others.
GEOS is a core dependency of PostGIS, QGIS, GDAL, and Shapely.

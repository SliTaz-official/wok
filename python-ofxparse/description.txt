Ofxparse is a parser for Open Financial Exchange (.ofx) format files.
OFX files are available from almost any online banking site, so they
work well if you want to pull together your finances from multiple
sources.
Online trading accounts also provide account statements in OFX files.

There are three different types of OFX files, called BankAccount,
CreditAccount and InvestmentAccount files.
This library has been tested with real-world samples of all three types.

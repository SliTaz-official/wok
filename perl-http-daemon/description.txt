Instances of the HTTP::Daemon class are HTTP/1.1 servers
that listen on a socket for incoming requests.
The HTTP::Daemon is a subclass of IO::Socket::IP, so you
can perform socket operations directly on it too.

Please note that HTTP::Daemon used to be a subclass of
IO::Socket::INET.
To support IPv6, it switched the parent class to IO::Socket::IP
at version 6.05.

The accept() method will return when a connection from a
client is available. The returned value will be an
HTTP::Daemon::ClientConn object which is another
IO::Socket::IP subclass.
Calling the get_request() method on this object will read
data from the client and return an HTTP::Request object.
The ClientConn object also provide methods to send back
various responses.

This HTTP daemon does not fork(2) for you.
Your application, i.e. the user of the HTTP::Daemon is
responsible for forking if that is desirable.
Also note that the user is responsible for generating
responses that conform to the HTTP/1.1 protocol.

Ever get the feeling that nothing is going right? You're a sysadmin, and 
someone's trying to destroy your computers. The little people running around the
screen are trying to infect your computers with Wingdows [TM], a virus cleverly 
designed to resemble a popular operating system. Additionally, some computers 
are connected with network cables. When one computer on a network becomes 
infected, a spark will be sent down the cable, and will infect the computer on 
the other end when it reaches there.

That's the basic idea of the game. Pretty simple, but fun for a while, and 
definitely something to appreciate.

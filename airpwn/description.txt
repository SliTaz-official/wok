Airpwn is a framework for 802.11 (wireless) packet injection. Airpwn listens 
to incoming wireless packets, and if the data matches a pattern specified in 
the config files, custom content is injected "spoofed" from the wireless 
access point. From the perspective of the wireless client, airpwn becomes the 
server.

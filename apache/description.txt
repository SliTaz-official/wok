The Apache HTTP Server is an open-source HTTP server for modern operating 
systems including UNIX, Microsoft Windows, Mac OS/X and Netware. The goal of 
this project is to provide a secure, efficient and extensible server that 
provides HTTP services observing the current HTTP standards. Apache has been the
most popular web server on the Internet since April of 1996.

Catfish is a handy file searching tool for linux and unix. Basically it is
a frontend for different search engines (daemons) which provides a unified
interface. The interface is intentionally lightweight and simple, using only
GTK+2 and Python. You can configure it to your needs by using several command
line options.

You are encouraged to run 'catfish --help' to check out the various command
line options.

WavPack is a completely open audio compression format providing lossless,
high-quality lossy, and a unique hybrid compression mode.

In the default lossless mode WavPack acts just like a WinZip compressor
for audio files. However, unlike MP3 or WMA encoding which can affect the
sound quality, not a single bit of the original information is lost, so
there's no chance of degradation. This makes lossless mode ideal for
archiving audio material or any other situation where quality is paramount.
The compression ratio depends on the source material, but generally is
between 30% and 70%.

The hybrid mode provides all the advantages of lossless compression with an
additional bonus. Instead of creating a single file, this mode creates both
a relatively small, high-quality lossy file that can be used all by itself,
and a "correction" file that (when combined with the lossy file) provides
full lossless restoration. For some users this means never having to choose
between lossless and lossy compression!

WavPack employs only well known, public domain techniques (i.e., linear
prediction with LMS adaptation, Elias and Golomb codes) in its
implementation.
Methods and algorithms that have ever been patented (e.g., arithmetic
coding, LZW compression) are specifically avoided. This ensures that WavPack
encoders and decoders will remain open and royalty-free.

diffpdf is used to compare two PDF files.

By default the comparison is of the words on each pair of pages,
but comparing character by character is also supported (e.g., for
logographic languages).
And there's also support for comparing the pages by appearance
(for example, if a diagram is changed or if a paragraph is
reformatted, or a font changed).
It is also possible to compare particular pages or page ranges.

Date::Manip is a series of modules designed to make any common
date or time operation easy to do.
Operations such as comparing two times, determining a date a
given amount of time from another, or parsing international
times are all easily done.
It deals with time as it is used in the Gregorian calendar
(the one currently in use) with full support for time changes
due to daylight saving time.

From the very beginning, the main focus of Date::Manip has been
to be able to do ANY desired date or time operation easily.
Many other modules exist which may do a subset of these
operations quicker or more efficiently, but no other module
can do all of the operations available in Date::Manip.

Date::Manip has functionality to work with several fundamental
types of data.

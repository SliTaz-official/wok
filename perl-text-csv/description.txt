Text::CSV is a thin wrapper for Text::CSV_XS-compatible modules now.
All the backend modules provide facilities for the composition and
decomposition of comma-separated values.
Text::CSV uses Text::CSV_XS by default, and when Text::CSV_XS is not
available, falls back on Text::CSV_PP, which is bundled in the same
distribution as this module.

Linld 0.97

Linld is a Linux loader for DOS. I wrote it when loadlin failed to load newer
kernel for me and I found loadlin source to bee too big and complex to fix.

So I just wrote a repacement.

Build instructions
------------------
You need a DOS/Windows machine. Download linld097devel.tar.bz2,
unpack it, cd DIST/LINLD097 and run !COMPILE.BAT

Usage
-----

LINLD [image=<file>] [initrd=<file>] [vga=vgamode] [cl=<kernel cmdline>]
vgamode: ask,extended,normal or dec/oct/hex number
Defaults:
        image=bzImage
        initrd=(nothing)
        cl=auto
        vga=0
Use quotes: "cl=..." if you need spaces in cmdline
Use cl=@filename to take cmdline from file

Acknowledgements
----------------
Lots of code was borrowed from loadlin source
(author of loadlin is Hans Lermen <lermen@elserv.ffm.fgan.de>).
Some code from linux kernel (setup.S) was used too.
Thank you guys!

Changelog
---------
0.91    Added support for cl=@filename
0.92    VCPI voodoo magic: booting under EMM386 and foes :-)
0.93    Cleanup. cl=@filename: cr/lf will be converted to two spaces
0.94    Ugly workaround for DOS int 15 fn 88 breakage
0.95    Bug squashed: vga=NNN did not like dec numbers, oct/hex only
        Some VCPI comments added
0.96    Do not lowercase entire command line
0.97    memtop() must be rounded down to page boundary

SliTaz patches
--------------
New command line arguments:
-f		force. Do not ask memory manager for allocation
-b base		lower buffer address, default 1088k
root number	root filesystem device
mem number	higher memory address, default 256m

Every arguments can be stored in a separate file and load with @filename, i.e
> linld @args.cmd

The -f and -b are useful skip XMM (max 64M ?) and VCPI (max 32M ?) limits:
> linld -f -b 64m initrd=rootfs4.gz,rootfs3.gz,rootfs2.gz,rootfs1.gz "cl=video=-32"

The Cantarell font family is designed as a contemporary Humanist sans serif and
is particularly designed for on-screen reading on mobile devices at small sizes,
such as phones and tablets.

This is the open font officially chosen by default for the GNOME 3 desktop and
for Fedora branding materials.

Regular and bold weights are provided for now. Italics are planned.

Each font file currently contains 391 glyphs, and fully support the following
writing systems: Basic Latin, Western European, Catalan, Baltic, Turkish,
Central European, Dutch and Afrikaans.

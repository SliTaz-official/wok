Fping is a program to send ICMP echo probes to network hosts,
similar to ping, but much better performing when pinging multiple
hosts.
Fping has a very long history: Roland Schemers did publish a first
version of it in 1992 and it has established itself since then as
a standard tool for network diagnostics and statistics.

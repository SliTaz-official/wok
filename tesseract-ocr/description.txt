This package contains an OCR engine - libtesseract and
a command line program - tesseract.

Tesseract 4 adds a new neural net (LSTM) based OCR engine
which is focused on line recognition, but also still
supports the legacy Tesseract OCR engine of Tesseract 3
which works by recognizing character patterns.
Compatibility with Tesseract 3 is enabled by using the
Legacy OCR Engine mode (--oem 0).
It also needs traineddata files which support the legacy
engine, for example those from the tessdata repository.

The lead developer is Ray Smith. The maintainer is Zdenko
Podobny.
For a list of contributors see AUTHORS and GitHub's log
of contributors.

Tesseract has unicode (UTF-8) support, and can recognize
more than 100 languages "out of the box".

Tesseract supports various output formats: plain text,
hOCR (HTML), PDF, invisible-text-only PDF, TSV.
The main branch also has experimental support for ALTO
(XML) output.

You should note that in many cases, in order to get better
OCR results, you'll need to improve the quality of the
image you are giving Tesseract.

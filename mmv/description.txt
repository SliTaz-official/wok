This is mmv, a program to move/copy/append/link multiple files according to a
set of wildcard patterns. All csh wildcards ('*', '?', '['...']', and '~') are
supported. This multiple action is performed safely, i.e. without any
unexpected deletion of files due to collisions of target names with existing
filenames or with other target names. Furthermore, before doing anything, mmv
attempts to detect any errors that would result from the entire set of actions
specified and gives the user the choice of either aborting before beginning, or
proceeding by avoiding the offending parts.

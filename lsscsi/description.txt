The lsscsi command lists information about SCSI devices in Linux.
Using SCSI terminology, lsscsi lists SCSI logical units
(or SCSI targets when the '--transport' option is given).
The default action is to produce one line of output for each SCSI device
currently attached to the system.
In version 0.30 of this utility, support was added to list NVMe namespaces
(under SCSI devices(LUs)) and NVMe controllers (under SCSI hosts).

When the '--hosts' option is given the lsscsi command lists information
about SCSI hosts attached to the system.
A host can be actual hardware (sometimes referred to as Host Bus Adapters
(HBAs)) or virtual.
An example of a virtual host is USB mass storage that bridges between USB
and the SCSI subsystem. In SCSI parlance, a host is referred to as an
SCSI initiator.

The lsscsi command scans the sysfs pseudo file system that was introduced
in the 2.6 Linux kernel series.
Since most users have permissions to read sysfs (usually mounted at /sys )
then meta information can be found on some or all SCSI devices without a
user needing elevated permissions to access special files (e.g. /dev/sda ).
The lsscsi command can also show the relationship between a device's
primary node name, its SCSI generic (sg) node name and its kernel name.

The lsscsi command works in the 2.6, 3, 4 and 5 Linux kernel series.

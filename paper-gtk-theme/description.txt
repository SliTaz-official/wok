Paper is a modern desktop theme suite. Its design is mostly flat with a minimal
use of shadows for depth.

Paper has been developed primarily with modern GTK3 (GNOME-based) desktop
environments in mind, legacy-toolkit and GTK2 environments will not provide an
ideal experience, as much of the visual design relies on modern GTK3+ widgets.

Paper is distributed under the terms the GNU General Public License

Net::DNS is a collection of Perl modules that act as a Domain Name System
(DNS) resolver.
It allows the programmer to perform DNS queries that are beyond the
capabilities of "gethostbyname" and "gethostbyaddr".

The programmer should be familiar with the structure of a DNS packet.
See RFC 1035 or DNS and BIND (Albitz & Liu) for details.

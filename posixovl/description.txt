With posixovl it is possible to mount FAT, VFAT, NTFS file system so that it
behaves like POSIX. File permissions, symbolic links etc. are supported
transparently. An extra file stores the information and the file system itself
stays unmodified. It is a modern equivalent of the UMSDOS file system.

Typical use: Mount an USB FAT32 drive with posixovl and your files retain their
permission settings.

This package extends mount and provides option '-t posixovl'.

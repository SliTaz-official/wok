IPerf3 is a tool for active measurements of the maximum achievable
bandwidth on IP networks.
It supports tuning of various parameters related to timing, buffers
and protocols (TCP, UDP, SCTP with IPv4 and IPv6).
For each test it reports the bandwidth, loss, and other parameters.
This is a new implementation that shares no code with the original
iPerf and also is not backwards compatible.

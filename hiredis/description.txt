Hiredis is a minimalistic C client library for the Redis database.

It is minimalistic because it just adds minimal support for the
protocol, but at the same time it uses a high level printf-alike API
in order to make it much higher level than otherwise suggested by
its minimal code base and the lack of explicit bindings for every
Redis command.

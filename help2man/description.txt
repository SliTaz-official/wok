Help2man is a tool for automatically generating simple manual pages
from program output.

Although manual pages are optional for GNU programs other projects,
such as Debian require them (see Man Pages in GNU Coding Standards).

This program is intended to provide an easy way for software authors
to include a manual page in their distribution without having to
maintain that document.

Given a program which produces reasonably standard "--help" and
"--version" outputs, help2man can re-arrange that output into
something which resembles a manual page.

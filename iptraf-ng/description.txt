IPTraf-ng is a console-based network monitoring utility.
IPTraf gathers data like TCP connection packet and byte counts,
interface statistics and activity indicators, TCP/UDP traffic
breakdowns, and LAN station packet and byte counts.
IPTraf-ng features include an IP traffic monitor which shows
TCP flag information, packet and byte counts, ICMP details,
OSPF packet types, and oversized IP packet warnings;
interface statistics showing IP, TCP, UDP, ICMP, non-IP and
other IP packet counts, IP checksum errors, interface activity
and packet size counts;
a TCP and UDP service monitor showing counts of incoming and
outgoing packets for common TCP and UDP application ports,
a LAN statistics module that discovers active hosts and displays
statistics about their activity;
TCP, UDP and other protocol display filters so you can view just
the traffic you want; logging; support for Ethernet, FDDI, ISDN,
SLIP, PPP, and loopback interfaces;
and utilization of the built-in raw socket interface of the Linux
kernel, so it can be used on a wide variety of supported network
cards.

The Revision Control System (RCS) manages multiple revisions of files.
RCS automates the storing, retrieval, logging, identification, and merging
of revisions.
RCS is useful for text that is revised frequently, including source code,
programs, documentation, graphics, papers, and form letters.

RCS was first developed by Walter F. Tichy at Purdue University in the early
1980s -- paper: RCS: A System for Version Control (1991) (troff, PostScript, PDF).
See also the Purdue RCS Homepage.

RCS design is an improvement from its predecessor Source Code Control System (SCCS)
(see GNU CSSC).
The improvements include an easier user interface and improved storage of versions
for faster retrieval.
RCS improves performance by storing an entire copy of the most recent version and
then stores reverse differences (called "deltas").
RCS uses GNU Diffutils to find the differences between versions.

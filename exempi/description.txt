Exempi is an implementation of XMP.
Version 2.x is based on Adobe XMP SDK and released under a BSD-style
license like Adobe's.
The 3 clause BSD (aka New-BSD) license is compatible with GPL.
The licensing is kept identical in order to allow two-way merging of
the code (ie sending our change to the XMP SDK to Adobe for integration).

The API is C based and means to be used from any language and be easier
to maintain ABI stability.

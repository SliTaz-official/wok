The TrueType core fonts for the web that was once available from
<http://www.microsoft.com/typography/fontpack/>. The package is constructed so
that the actual fonts are downloaded from Sourceforge's site at build time.
Therefore this package technically does not "redistribute" the fonts, it just
makes it easy to install them on a linux system.

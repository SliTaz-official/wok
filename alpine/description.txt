Alpine is a fast, easy to use email client that is suitable for both the 
inexperienced email user as well as for the most demanding of power users. 
Alpine is based on the PineÂ® Message System, which was also developed at the 
University of Washington. Alpine can be learned by exploration and the use of 
context-sensitive help. The user experience is highly customizable through 
the use of the Alpine Setup command.

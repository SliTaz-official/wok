Giac/Xcas is a free computer algebra system for Windows, Mac OS X and
Linux/Unix.

Xcas is an interface to perform computer algebra, function graphs,
interactive geometry (2-d and 3-d), spreadsheet and statistics,
programmation. It may be used as a replacement for high end graphic
calculators for example on netbooks (for about the same price as a
calculator but with much more performances).

Xcas is based on the FLTK graphic toolkit, there is an alternate less
mature interface based on QT named qcas.

Xcas offline in your browser is an interface to Giac with less
functionnalities but working in a compatible browser without
installation, Firefox is recommended.

Giac is a C++ library, it is the CAS computing kernel, it may be used
inside other C++ programs, and also Python, Java and Javascript programs.

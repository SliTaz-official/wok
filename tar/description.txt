GNU Tar provides the ability to create tar archives,
as well as various other kinds of manipulation.
For example, you can use Tar on previously created
archives to extract files, to store additional files,
or to update or list files which were already stored.

Initially, tar archives were used to store files
conveniently on magnetic tape.
The name "Tar" comes from this use; it stands for
tape archiver.
Despite the utility's name, Tar can direct its
output to available devices, files, or other programs
(using pipes), it can even access remote devices or
files (as archives).

ListPatron is an (GTK) application for maintaining lists of information. 
It operates on the basis of rows and columns. Cells can be of a variety of 
different types like text, icon, etc. (At the moment only text). ListPatron will
support advanced sorting, filtering, reports, Row/Column views and Record-based 
views and any other nice features you can come up with.

Provides an adapter layer between core routines for converting to and from
UTF8 and other encodings.
In essence, a way to give multiple existing Unicode modules a single common
interface so you don't have to know the underlaying implementations to do
simple UTF8 to-from other character set encoding conversions.
As such, it wraps the Unicode::String, Unicode::Map8, Unicode::Map and
Jcode modules in a standardized and simple API.

This also provides general character set conversion operation based on UTF8
- it is possible to convert between any two compatible and supported
character sets via a simple two step chaining of conversions.

As with most things Perlish - if you give it a few big chunks of text to
chew on instead of lots of small ones it will handle many more characters
per second.

By design, it can be easily extended to encompass any new charset encoding
conversion modules that arrive on the scene.

This module is intended to provide good Unicode support to versions of
Perl prior to 5.8.
If you are using Perl 5.8.0 or later, you probably want to be using the
Encode module instead.
This module does work with Perl 5.8, but Encode is the preferred method
in that environment.

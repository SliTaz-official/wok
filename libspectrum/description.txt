libspectrum is a library designed to make the input and output of
some ZX Spectrum emulator files slightly easier.
It is intended to be usable on Unix variants, Win32 and Mac OS X.
Currently, it is mainly (only?) used by Fuse, but other Spectrum
emulator and utility authors are encouraged to use it.

Tinyproxy is a light-weight HTTP and HTTPS proxy daemon
for POSIX operating systems.
Designed from the ground up to be fast and yet small,
it is an ideal solution for use cases such as embedded
deployments where a full featured HTTP proxy is required,
but the system resources for a larger proxy are unavailable.

Opencpn was built with the following objectives in mind:

  1. Intended use as primary navigation interface for vessels with full-time
     helm-visible navigational suites. Other tools may be better for offline
     route planning, tide and current prediction, online logging, etc.
  2. Quick startup and shutdown.
  3. Those and only those toolbar buttons really needed for daily operation.
  4. Portability, thus wxWidgets core components. Currently tested and in
     production use on W98, XP, OSx, and Linux.
  5. Conventional (i.e. popular and modern) chart format support. In the real
     world, this means BSB format raster charts, and S57ENC format vector charts.

Requests is a simple, yet elegant, HTTP library.

Requests allows you to send HTTP/1.1 requests extremely easily.
There's no need to manually add query strings to your URLs, or to form-encode
your PUT & POST data - but nowadays, just use the json method!

Requests is one of the most downloaded Python packages today, pulling in
around 30M downloads/week - according to GitHub, Requests is currently depended
upon by 1,000,000+ repositories. You may certainly put your trust in this code.

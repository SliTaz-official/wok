LVM2 refers to the userspace toolset that provide logical volume management
facilities on linux.
It is reasonably backwards-compatible with the original LVM toolset.

To use LVM2 you need 3 things:
- device-mapper in your kernel,
- the userspace device-mapper support library (libdevmapper) and
- the userspace LVM2 tools.

Please look at https://sourceware.org/dm/ for information about the device-mapper
kernel and userspace components.

Aircrack-ng is a complete suite of tools to assess WiFi network security.

It focuses on different areas of WiFi security:

 * Monitoring: Packet capture and export of data to text files for further 
   processing by third party tools.

 * Attacking: Replay attacks, deauthentication, fake access points and others 
   via packet injection.

 * Testing: Checking WiFi cards and driver capabilities (capture and 
   injection).

 * Cracking: WEP and WPA PSK (WPA 1 and 2).

All tools are command line which allows for heavy scripting. A lot of GUIs 
have taken advantage of this feature. It works primarily Linux but also 
Windows, OS X, FreeBSD, OpenBSD, NetBSD, as well as Solaris and even 
eComStation 2.

Hostapd is a user space daemon for access point and authentication
servers.
It implements IEEE 802.11 access point management,
IEEE 802.1X/WPA/WPA2/EAP Authenticators, RADIUS client, EAP server,
and RADIUS authentication server.
The current version supports Linux (Host AP, madwifi, mac80211-based
drivers) and FreeBSD (net80211).

hostapd is designed to be a "daemon" program that runs in the
background and acts as the backend component controlling authentication.
Hostapd supports separate frontend programs and an example text-based
frontend, hostapd_cli, is included with hostapd.

tnylpo allows the execution of programs written for CP/M-80 version 2.2 under
Unixy operating systems. It has been tested under Linux, and Mac OS X, but
should need little to no modifications to run under any other reasonably
recent system. The companion program tnylpo-convert converts text files to
and from the CP/M format.

Bygfoot is a football (a.k.a. soccer) management game. It is an original concept
by Gyözö Both and has been improved with suggestions by players from all over
the world. After Gyözö and later Mark Lawrenz left the project Ronald Sterckx
took over and is currently developing and maintaining Bygfoot.

Bygfoot allows you to manage a team by training the players, buying and selling
them, contracting loans, maintaining the stadium, etc. You can be promoted or
relegated, even become a champion if you’re a skillful manager.

The game is deliberately kept simple (though not easy): you only have to keep
one eye at your players and another at your stadium.

You can customise Bygfoot by writing your own country definition files or by
creating your own team definition files. See the Definitions forum for help and
hints.

compiled successfully in several Linux distros, Windows and Mac.

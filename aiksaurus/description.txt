Aiksaurus is a set of libraries and applications which provide a thesaurus 
(currently English only, based on Guttenburg's Moby thesaurus) using native 
GUI on several platforms: UNIX (GTK+ & Qt), Win32 & MacOSX (Cocoa). The core 
library itself is platform-independent. The principal language is C++, with 
some use of Cocoa/ObjC++; wrappers are provided for C and Cocoa/ObjC.

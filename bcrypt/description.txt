Bcrypt is a cross platform file encryption utility. Encrypted files are 
portable across all supported operating systems and processors. Passphrases 
must be between 8 and 56 characters and are hashed internally to a 448 bit 
key. However, all characters supplied are significant. The stronger your 
passphrase, the more secure your data.

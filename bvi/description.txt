BVI 1.4.0 

The bvi is a display-oriented editor for binary files (hex editor), based on 
the vi texteditor. If you are familiar with vi, just start the editor and begin 
to edit! A bmore program is also included in the package. If you never heard 
about vi, maybe bvi is not the best choice for you. 

You will find now four new commands: 

    bvi     The binary editor 
    bview   The readonly version of bvi 
    bvedit  The beginners version of bvi 
    bmore   The binary more program

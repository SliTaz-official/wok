x11vnc allows to view remotely and interact with real X displays
(i.e. a display corresponding to a physical monitor, keyboard, and mouse)
with any VNC viewer.
In this way it plays the role for Unix/X11 that WinVNC plays for Windows.

It has built-in SSL/TLS encryption and 2048 bit RSA authentication,
including VeNCrypt support; UNIX account and password login support;
server-side scaling; single port HTTPS/HTTP+VNC; Zeroconf service advertising;
and TightVNC and UltraVNC file-transfer.
It has also been extended to work with non-X devices:
natively on Mac OS X Aqua/Quartz, webcams and TV tuner capture devices,
and embedded Linux systems such as Qtopia Core.
Full IPv6 support is provided.

It also provides an encrypted Terminal Services mode (-create, -svc, or -xdmsvc options)
based on Unix usernames and Unix passwords where the user does not need to memorize
his VNC display/port number.
Normally a virtual X session (Xvfb) is created for each user, but it also works with
X sessions on physical hardware. See the tsvnc terminal services mode of the SSVNC viewer
for one way to take advantage of this mode.

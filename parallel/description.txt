GNU parallel is a shell tool for executing jobs in parallel
using one or more computers.
A job can be a single command or a small script that has to
be run for each of the lines in the input.
The typical input is a list of files, a list of hosts, a
list of users, a list of URLs, or a list of tables.
A job can also be a command that reads from a pipe. GNU
parallel can then split the input and pipe it into commands
in parallel.

DRBD is a software-based, shared-nothing, replicated storage solution
mirroring the content of block devices (hard disks, partitions, logical
volumes etc.) between hosts.

DRBD mirrors data

* in real time. Replication occurs continuously while applications
  modify the data on the device.
* transparently. Applications need not be aware that the data is stored
  on multiple hosts.
* synchronously or asynchronously. With synchronous mirroring,
  applications are notified of write completions after the writes have
  been carried out on all (connected) hosts. With asynchronous mirroring,
  applications are notified of write completions when the writes have
  completed locally, which usually is before they have propagated to the
  other hosts.

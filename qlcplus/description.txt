QLC+ is a free and cross-platform software to control DMX or analog lighting
systems like moving heads, dimmers, scanners etc.

This project is a fork of the great [QLC project]
(http://qlc.sourceforge.net/index.shtml) written by Heikki Junnila that aims to
continue the development of QLC and to introduce new features.

The primary goal is to bring QLC+ at the level of other lighting control
commercial softwares.

QLC+ runs on Linux, Windows, OSX and the Raspberry Pi.

Asterisk includes a set of standard sound files in various formats. The core 
part of that collection in Canadian French, by voice actress June Wallack, is 
contained in various encodings in packages asterisk-core-sounds-fr-*; this 
package registers these through the alternatives system to provide the 
default "fr" (French).

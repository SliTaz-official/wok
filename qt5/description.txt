Qt is a widget toolkit for creating graphical user interfaces as well as
cross-platform applications that run on various software and hardware
platforms such as Linux, Windows, macOS, Android or embedded systems with
little or no change in the underlying codebase while still being a native
application with native capabilities and speed.

LADSPA is a standard that allows software audio processors and effects
to be plugged into a wide range of audio synthesis and recording packages.

For instance, it allows a developer to write a reverb program and bundle
it into a LADSPA "plugin library".
Ordinary users can then use this reverb within any LADSPA-friendly audio
application. Most major audio applications on Linux support LADSPA.

Musl is an implementation of the C standard library built
on top of the Linux system call API, including interfaces
defined in the base language standard, POSIX, and widely
agreed-upon extensions.

Musl is lightweight, fast, simple, free, and strives to be
correct in the sense of standards-conformance and safety.

OpenSSH is the premier connectivity tool for remote login
with the SSH protocol.
It encrypts all traffic to eliminate eavesdropping,
connection hijacking, and other attacks.
In addition, OpenSSH provides a large suite of secure
tunneling capabilities, several authentication methods,
and sophisticated configuration options.

SQLObject is a popular Object Relational Manager for providing
an object interface to your database, with tables as classes,
rows as instances, and columns as attributes.

SQLObject includes a Python-object-based query language that
makes SQL more abstract, and provides substantial database
independence for applications.

Supports MySQL, PostgreSQL, SQLite, Firebird, Sybase, MSSQL
and MaxDB (SAPDB).

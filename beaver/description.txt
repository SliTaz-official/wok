Beaver is a GTK+2 editor designed to be:

Light-weight :: Beaver starts up fast and doesn't use a lot of memory. 
Beaver's only dependency is GTK+2, so no need to install other libraries 
eating your disk space. These things make Beaver very suitable for old 
computers and use in small Linux distributions.

Modular :: The Beaver core just supplies basic functionality and syntax 
highlighting. Additional functionality can be found in plugins, which are 
available on our Plugins page. This way, we make it possible for you to 
customize Beaver to your personal flavour.

Stylish :: A clean interface, enabling you to do your work efficiently, and 
high-quality Tango artwork.

Beaver is an Early AdVanced EditoR.

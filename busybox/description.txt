BusyBox combines tiny versions of many common UNIX utilities into a single 
small executable. It provides replacements for most of the utilities you 
usually find in GNU fileutils, shellutils, etc. The utilities in BusyBox 
generally have fewer options than their full-featured GNU cousins; however, 
the options that are included provide the expected functionality and behave 
very much like their GNU counterparts. BusyBox provides a fairly complete 
environment for any small or embedded system.

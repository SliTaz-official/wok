This package provides a C encoder and decoder implementation for DEC SIXEL graphics
in the libsixel.so shared library, and two converter programs, img2sixel and sixel2png.

SIXEL is one of image formats for printer and terminal imaging introduced by
Digital Equipment Corp. (DEC).
Its data scheme is represented as a terminal-friendly escape sequence.
So if you want to view a SIXEL image file, all you have to do is "cat" it to your terminal.

DateTime is a class for the representation of date and time combinations,
and is part of the Perl DateTime project.

It represents the Gregorian calendar, extended backwards in time before
its creation (in 1582).
This is sometimes known as the "proleptic Gregorian calendar".
In this calendar, the first day of the calendar (the epoch), is the first
day of year 1, which corresponds to the date which was (incorrectly)
believed to be the birth of Jesus Christ.

The calendar represented does have a year 0, and in that way differs
from how dates are often written using "BCE/CE" or "BC/AD".

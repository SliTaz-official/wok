GD is an open source code library for the dynamic creation of images
by programmers.
GD is written in C, and "wrappers" are available for Perl, PHP, ruby
and many other bindings.

GD has builtin support for:

* BMP (builtin)
* GIF with animation support (builtin)
* TGA (builtin)
* WBMP (builtin)
* WebP via libwebp
* PNG via libpng
* JPEG using external library:
     libjpeg-turbo (recommended)
     libJpeg-
     Does not include JPEG2000
* AVIF via libavif
* HEIF via libheif - This includes AVIF read support if your system's
   libheif has AV1 decoding.
* TIFF via libtiff
* XPM via libXpm

GD is commonly used to generate charts, graphics, thumbnails, and most
anything else, on the fly. It is lite weight and fits usages like web
development, embemdedded, or any other usages you may need.

It supports transparency, blending, images transformations and various
filters. Its design allows the additions of custom features in a very
friendly manner.

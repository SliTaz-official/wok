nnn is a full-featured file manager for low-end devices and the regular desktop.
It's extremely light and fast (performance).

nnn is also a disk usage analyzer, a fuzzy app launcher, a batch file renamer and
a file picker. Many plugins are available to extend its power.
Custom plugins are easy to add.
There's an independent (neo)vim picker plugin project.

It runs on Linux, macOS, Raspberry Pi, BSD, Cygwin, Linux subsystem for Windows and
Termux on Android. nnn works seamlessly with DEs and GUI utilities. It's nearly
zero-config (with sensible defaults) and can be setup in less than 5 minutes.

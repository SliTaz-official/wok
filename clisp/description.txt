Common Lisp is a high-level, general-purpose, object-oriented, dynamic, 
functional programming language.

CLISP is a Common Lisp implementation by Bruno Haible, then of Karlsruhe 
University, and Michael Stoll, then of Munich University, both in Germany. It 
implements the language described in the ANSI Common Lisp standard with many 
extensions.

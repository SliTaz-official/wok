Description
===========

Pale Moon is an open source, web browser based on Firefox focusing on efficiency
by leaving out unnecessary features and making optimizations, while maintaining
compatibility with Firefox extensions and themes.

Pale Moon provides a familiar set of controls and visual feedback similar
to previous versions of Firefox, including grouped navigation buttons,
a bookmarks toolbar that is enabled by default, tabs next to page content
by default, and a functional status bar.

This is a third party build; the original project is at www.palemoon.org.

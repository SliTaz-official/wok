The purpose of these patches is to freely provide the nicest font rendering
of any operating system. The second goal is to provide customization so that
the end user is able to adjust the settings to his or her taste. Most common
operating system font appearances can be emulated with these patches.

The local.conf has been replaced with fontconfig-infinality, which drops into
an existing /etc/fonts/. This should help distro maintainers greatly. It is
strongly recommended to use these fontconfig settings, as they are tailored
to work with the Freetype patches.

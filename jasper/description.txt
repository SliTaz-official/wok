The JasPer Project is an open-source initiative to provide a free
software-based reference implementation of the codec specified in
the JPEG-2000 Part-1 standard (i.e., ISO/IEC 15444-1).
This project was started as a collaborative effort between Image
Power, Inc. and the University of British Columbia.
Presently, the ongoing maintenance and development of the JasPer
software is being coordinated by its principal author, Michael Adams,
who is affiliated with the Digital Signal Processing Group (DSPG)
in the Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering at the
University of Victoria.

JasPer includes a software-based implementation of the codec
specified in the JPEG-2000 Part-1 standard (i.e., ISO/IEC 15444-1).
The JasPer software is written in the C programming language.

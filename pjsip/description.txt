PJSIP is a free and open source multimedia communication library
written in C language implementing standard based protocols such
as SIP, SDP, RTP, STUN, TURN, and ICE.
It combines signaling protocol (SIP) with rich multimedia framework
and NAT traversal functionality into high level API that is portable
and suitable for almost any type of systems ranging from desktops,
embedded systems, to mobile handsets.

PJSIP is both compact and feature rich.
It supports audio, video, presence, and instant messaging, and has
extensive documentation. PJSIP is very portable.
On mobile devices, it abstracts system dependent features and in
many cases is able to utilize the native multimedia capabilities of
the device.

PJSIP has been developed by a small team working exclusively for the
project since 2005, with participation of hundreds of developers
from around the world, and is routinely tested at SIP Interoperability
Event (SIPit ) since 2007.

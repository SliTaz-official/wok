GMP is a free library for arbitrary precision arithmetic, operating
on signed integers, rational numbers, and floating-point numbers.
There is no practical limit to the precision except the ones implied
by the available memory in the machine GMP runs on.
GMP has a rich set of functions, and the functions have a regular
interface.

The main target applications for GMP are cryptography applications
and research, Internet security applications, algebra systems,
computational algebra research, etc.

LXC is a userspace interface for the Linux kernel containment features.
Through a powerful API and simple tools, it lets Linux users easily
create and manage system or application containers.

Current LXC uses the following kernel features to contain processes:

- Kernel namespaces (ipc, uts, mount, pid, network and user)
- Apparmor and SELinux profiles
- Seccomp policies
- Chroots (using pivot_root)
- Kernel capabilities
- CGroups (control groups)

LXC containers are often considered as something in the middle between a
chroot and a full fledged virtual machine.
The goal of LXC is to create an environment as close as possible to a
standard Linux installation but without the need for a separate kernel.

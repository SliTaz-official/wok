Mutagen is a Python module to handle audio metadata. It supports ASF, FLAC, M4A,
Monkey's Audio, MP3, Musepack, Ogg Opus, Ogg FLAC, Ogg Speex, Ogg Theora, Ogg
Vorbis, True Audio, WavPack, OptimFROG, and AIFF audio files. All versions of
ID3v2 are supported, and all standard ID3v2.4 frames are parsed. It can read
Xing headers to accurately calculate the bitrate and length of MP3s. ID3 and
APEv2 tags can be edited regardless of audio format. It can also manipulate Ogg
streams on an individual packet/page level.

Mutagen works on Python 2.6, 2.7, 3.3, 3.4 (CPython and PyPy) and has
no dependencies outside the Python standard library.

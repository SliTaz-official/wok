LXSession is a lightweight X11 session manager with fewer dependencies, designed
for use with the LXDE (Lightweight X11 Desktop Environment). It derived from XSM
and have following differences:
  * Removed the session dialog from xsm.
  * Stripped down without session restore function.
  * Automaticlly restart specific program if crashes happened.
  * Use better configuration.
  * Provide a nice logout-dialog with the ability to shutdown / reboot /
    suspend / hibernate via HAL or gdm
  * Support halt/reboot LTSP thin clients, and more...

It's desktop-independent and can be used with any window manager.

As "session manager" lxsession used to automatically start a set of applications
and set up a working desktop environment

LXSession has also a built-in lightweight Xsettings daemon, which can configure
GTK+ themes, keyboard, and mouse for you on session startup.

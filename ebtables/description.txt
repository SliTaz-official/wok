The ebtables program is a filtering tool for a Linux-based bridging firewall.
It enables transparent filtering of network traffic passing through a
Linux bridge.
The filtering possibilities are limited to link layer filtering and some
basic filtering on higher network layers. Advanced logging, MAC DNAT/SNAT
and brouter facilities are also included.

The ebtables tool can be combined with the other Linux filtering tools
(iptables, ip6tables and arptables) to make a bridging firewall that is also
capable of filtering these higher network layers. This is enabled through
the bridge-netfilter architecture which is a part of the standard Linux kernel.

The ebtables and arptables codebase is maintained by the netfilter developers,
who were so kind to take over maintenance of the software.

Celestia is a space simulation that lets you explore the universe in three
dimensions.

Unlike most planetarium software, Celestia doesn't confine you to the surface of
the Earth. You can travel throughout the solar system, to any of over 100,000 
stars, or even beyond the galaxy.

All movement in Celestia is seamless; the exponential zoom feature lets you 
explore space across a huge range of scales, from galaxy clusters down to 
spacecraft only a few meters across. A 'point-and-goto' interface makes it 
simple to navigate through the universe to the object you want to visit.

Celestia is expandable. Celestia comes with a large catalog of stars, galaxies, 
planets, moons, asteroids, comets, and spacecraft. If that's not enough, you can
download dozens of easy to install add-ons with more objects.

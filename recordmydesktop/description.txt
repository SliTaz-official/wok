RecordMyDesktop is a desktop session recorder for GNU / linux
that attemps to be easy to use, yet also effective at it's
primary task.

As such, the program is separated in two parts; a simple command
line tool that performs the basic tasks of capturing and encoding
and an interface that exposes the program functionality in a
usable way.

The commandline tool (which essentially is recordMyDesktop),
is written in C, while there are two frontends, written in python
with pyGtk (gtk-recordMyDesktop) and pyQt4 (qt-recordMyDesktop).

RecordMyDesktop offers also the ability to record audio through
ALSA, OSS or the JACK audio server.

Also, recordMyDesktop produces files using only open formats.
These are theora for video and vorbis for audio, using the ogg
container.
(To learn more about free formats visit Xiph.org, the foundation
responsible for the aformentioned formats).

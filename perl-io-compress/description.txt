This module provides a Perl interface that allows the reading of
files or buffers that have been compressed with a variety of
compression libraries.

The formats supported are:

RFC 1950
RFC 1951 (optionally)
gzip (RFC 1952)
zip
zstd (Zstandard)
bzip2
lzop
lzf
lzma
lzip
xz

The module will auto-detect which, if any, of the supported compression
formats is being used.

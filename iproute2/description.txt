Iproute2 is a collection of utilities for controlling TCP/IP networking
and traffic control in Linux.

Most network configuration manuals still refer to ifconfig and route as
the primary network configuration tools, but ifconfig is known to behave
inadequately in modern network environments.
They should be deprecated, but most distros still include them.
Most network configuration systems make use of ifconfig and thus provide
a limited feature set.
The /etc/net project aims to support most modern network technologies,
as it doesn't use ifconfig and allows a system administrator to make use
of all iproute2 features, including traffic control.

Apache Subversion is a full-featured version control system
originally designed to be a better CVS.
Subversion has since expanded beyond its original goal of
replacing CVS, but its basic model, design, and interface
remain heavily influenced by that goal.
Even today, Subversion should still feel very familiar to
CVS users.

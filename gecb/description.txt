Graphical Class Browser

This is a simple app to browse GNU EDMA classes installed in a system.

The aplication will show the GNU/EDMA shared repository plus any other
local repository in the file edma_repos.lst in the current directory.

Pressing F5 will update the class list. This is useful for testing
run-time class installation on shared repositories.

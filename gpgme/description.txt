GnuPG Made Easy (GPGME) is a C language library that allows to add
support for cryptography to a program.  It is designed to make access
to public key crypto engines like GnuPG or GpgSM easier for
applications.  GPGME provides a high-level crypto API for encryption,
decryption, signing, signature verification and key management.

GPGME uses GnuPG and GpgSM as its backends to support OpenPGP and the
Cryptographic Message Syntax (CMS).

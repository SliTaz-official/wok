Libisofs is a library to create an ISO-9660 filesystem, supports extensions
like RockRidge or Joliet, and introduces an own extension AAIP.
It is a full featured ISO-9660 editor which composes and changes the directory
tree of an ISO image. This tree and its newly imported data file contents get
then written as independent single-session image or as add-on session for the
image from where the tree was originally loaded.

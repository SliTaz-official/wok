ModSecurity is an open source, cross platform web application firewall (WAF)
developed by Trustwave's SpiderLabs.
It has a robust event-based programming language which provides protection
from a range of attacks against web applications and allows for HTTP traffic
monitoring, logging and real-time analysis.
With over 10,000 deployments world-wide, ModSecurity is the most widely
deployed WAF in existence.

AzPainter is a full color painting software for Linux for illustration
drawing.
Simple and easy to use and lightweight projects.
Small size easy to draw illustrations and edit, we like to use.
For larger image sizes is based on the printing purpose and the authentic
things to draw for you.

This is not suitable for dot editing. Since the color is handled with
16 bit color (15 bit fixed point number) internally, the accuracy of
color rises, but the memory is consumed correspondingly.

Xplanet was inspired by Xearth, which renders an image of the earth into the X 
root window. All of the major planets and most satellites can be drawn, similar 
to the Solar System Simulator. A number of different map projections are also 
supported, including azimuthal, Lambert, Mercator, Mollweide, orthographic, and 
rectangular.

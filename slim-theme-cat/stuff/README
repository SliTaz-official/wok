Source clip art "Cat and Spider" was found in the Google Pictures.
It's widely used for T-shirts and Mouse pads background (author unknown, sorry).
Image was outlined in the Inkscape, simplified and saved in vector format.

Panel was inspired by "flat" SLiM's theme panel.
It was outlined too, and semi-transparent gradients and shadow was adjusted
to have similar look.

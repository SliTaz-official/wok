The smartmontools package contains two programs (smartctl and smartd)
to control and monitor storage systems using the Self-Monitoring,
Analysis and Reporting Technology System (SMART) built into most modern
ATA/SATA, SCSI/SAS and NVMe disks.
In many cases, these utilities will provide advanced warning of disk
degradation and failure.
Smartmontools was originally derived from the Linux smartsuite package
and actually supports ATA/SATA, SCSI/SAS and NVMe disks and also
SCSI/SAS tape devices.

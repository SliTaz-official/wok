Taskwarrior manages your TODO list from your command line.
It is flexible, fast, efficient, unobtrusive, does its job
then gets out of your way.

Taskwarrior scales to fit your workflow.
Use it as a simple app that captures tasks, shows you the
list, and removes tasks from that list.
Leverage its capabilities though, and it becomes a
sophisticated data query tool that can help you stay
organized, and get through your work.

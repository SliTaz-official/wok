BaCon is a free BASIC to C translator for Unix-based systems,
which runs on most Unix, Linux or BSD platforms, including MacOSX.
It intends to be a programming aid in creating tools which can be
compiled on different platforms (32bit and 64bit), while trying to
revive the days of the good old BASIC.

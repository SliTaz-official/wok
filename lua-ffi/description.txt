This is a library for calling C functions and manipulating C types from lua.
It is designed to be interface compatible with the FFI library in luajit
(see http://luajit.org/ext_ffi.html).
It can parse C function declarations and struct definitions that have been
directly copied out of C header files and into lua source as a string.

Inxi is a command line system information script built for console
and IRC.
It is also used as a debugging tool for forum technical support to
quickly ascertain users' system configurations and hardware.
Inxi shows system hardware, CPU, drivers, Xorg, Desktop, Kernel,
gcc version(s), Processes, RAM usage, and a wide variety of other
useful information.

Inxi output varies depending on whether it is being used on CLI or
IRC, with some default filters and color options applied only for
IRC use. Script colors can be turned off if desired with -c 0, or
changed using the -c color options listed in the STANDARD OPTIONS
section.

This project provides backends, filters, and other software that was
once part of the core CUPS distribution but is no longer maintained
by Apple Inc.
In addition it contains additional filters and software developed
independently of Apple, especially filters for the PDF-centric
printing workflow introduced by OpenPrinting and a daemon to browse
Bonjour broadcasts of remote CUPS printers to make these printers
available locally and to provide backward compatibility to the old
CUPS broadcasting and browsing of CUPS 1.5.x and older.

From CUPS 1.6.0 on, this package is required for using printer
drivers with CUPS under Linux.
With CUPS 1.5.x and earlier this package can be used optionally to
switch over to PDF-based printing.

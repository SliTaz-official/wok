Net::Pcap is a Perl binding to the LBL pcap(3) library and its Win32 counterpart,
the WinPcap library.
Pcap (packet capture) is a portable API to capture network packet:
it allows applications to capture packets at link-layer, bypassing the normal
protocol stack.
It also provides features like kernel-level packet filtering and access to
internal statistics.

Common applications include network statistics collection, security monitoring,
network debugging, etc.

Asterisk is an Open Source PBX and telephony toolkit. It is, in a sense, 
middleware between Internet and telephony channels on the bottom, and 
Internet and telephony applications at the top.

Asterisk can be used with Voice over IP (SIP, H.323, IAX and more) standards, 
or the Public Switched Telephone Network (PSTN) through supported hardware.

A service that allows applications to request some extended actions for a list
of files depending on their mimetypes and some other constraints. Any user can
extend their applications by adding custom actions.

Similar to thunar-actions but distributed via dbus, any application can take
advantage of this service. extended-actions use traditional desktop files and
extend its format to configure special action(s) on files. Unity already
extended the desktop file application format with its quicklist.

Maybe one day this same application format will be extended at the glib level
within GAppInfo or in a new class or maybe a super daemon would arise providing
all the informations about applications and their new uses case. And this
service would be obsolete.

This project is the continuation of the work i already started in contractor.

extended-actions already provide a list of actions in
/usr/share/extended-actions.
Any user can define some custom actions in ~/.local/share/extended-actions

And if u have some good actions files don't hesitate to contact me i may include
them by default.

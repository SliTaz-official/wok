The MPFR library is a C library for multiple-precision floating-point
computations with correct rounding.
MPFR has continuously been supported by the INRIA and the current main
authors come from the Caramba and AriC project-teams at Loria
(Nancy, France) and LIP (Lyon, France) respectively.
MPFR is based on the GMP multiple-precision library.

The main goal of MPFR is to provide a library for multiple-precision
floating-point computation which is both efficient and has a
well-defined semantics.
It copies the good ideas from the ANSI/IEEE-754 standard for
double-precision floating-point arithmetic (53-bit significand).

The router advertisement daemon (radvd) is run by Linux or BSD systems
acting as IPv6 routers.
It sends Router Advertisement messages, specified by RFC 2461, to a local
Ethernet LAN periodically and when requested by a node sending a Router
Solicitation message.
These messages are required for IPv6 stateless autoconfiguration.

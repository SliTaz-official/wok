The main goals were to provide system call auditing with 1) as low overhead as 
possible, and 2) without duplicating functionality that is already provided by 
SELinux (and/or other security infrastructures). This framework will work 
"stand-alone", but is not designed to provide, e.g., CAPP functionality 
without another security component in place.

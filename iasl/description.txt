The iASL compiler and disassembler is a fully-featured translator
for the ACPI Source Language (ASL) and ACPI binary data tables.
As part of the Intel ACPI Component Architecture, the Intel ASL
compiler implements translation for the ACPI Source Language (ASL)
to the ACPI Machine Language (AML).
The disassembler feature will disassemble compiled AML code back
to (near-original) ASL source code.

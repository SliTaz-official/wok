GNU ddrescue is a data recovery tool.
It copies data from one file or block device (hard disc, cdrom, etc)
to another, trying to rescue the good parts first in case of read
errors.

Ddrescuelog is a tool that manipulates ddrescue mapfiles, shows
mapfile contents, converts mapfiles to and from other formats,
compares mapfiles, tests rescue status, and can delete a mapfile if
the rescue is done. Ddrescuelog operations can be restricted to one
or several parts of the mapfile if the domain setting options are used.

The basic operation of ddrescue is fully automatic.
That is, you don't have to wait for an error, stop the program,
restart it from a new position, etc.

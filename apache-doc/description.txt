The Apache HTTP Server Project's goal is to build a secure, efficient and 
extensible HTTP server as standards-compliant open source software. The 
result has long been the number one web server on the Internet.

This package provides the documentation for the Apache 2 HTTP server. The 
documentation is shipped in HTML format and can be accessed from a local 
running Apache HTTP server instance or by browsing the file system directly.

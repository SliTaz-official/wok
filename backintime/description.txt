Back In Time is a framework for rsync, diff and cron for the purpose of 
taking snapshots and backups of specified folders. It minimizes disk space 
use by taking a snapshot only if the directory has been changed, and hard 
links for unmodified files if it has. The user can schedule regular backups 
using cron.

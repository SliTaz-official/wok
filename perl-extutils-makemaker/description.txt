This utility is designed to write a Makefile for an extension module
from a Makefile.PL.
It is based on the Makefile.SH model provided by Andy Dougherty and
the perl5-porters.

It splits the task of generating the Makefile into several subroutines
that can be individually overridden. Each subroutine returns the text
it wishes to have written to the Makefile.

As there are various Make programs with incompatible syntax, which use
operating system shells, again with incompatible syntax, it is important
for users of this module to know which flavour of Make a Makefile has
been written for so they'll use the correct one and won't have to face
the possibly bewildering errors resulting from using the wrong one.

On POSIX systems, that program will likely be GNU Make;
on Microsoft Windows, it will be either Microsoft NMake, DMake or GNU Make.

ExtUtils::MakeMaker (EUMM) is object oriented. Each directory below the
current directory that contains a Makefile.PL is treated as a separate
object. This makes it possible to write an unlimited number of Makefiles
with a single invocation of WriteMakefile().

All inputs to WriteMakefile are Unicode characters, not just octets.
EUMM seeks to handle all of these correctly. It is currently still not
possible to portably use Unicode characters in module names, because
this requires Perl to handle Unicode filenames, which is not yet the
case on Windows.

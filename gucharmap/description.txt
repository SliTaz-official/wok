The Character Map application allows you to insert special characters into a
document or a text field. Character Map provides accented characters,
mathematical symbols, special symbols, and punctuation marks. Use Character Map
to access characters that are not available on your keyboard.

Character Map displays all the characters are available in all of the language
scripts on your system, using the Unicode character set. Unicode is a character
set standard with the goal to include all of the characters that are used in
all of the written languages in the world.

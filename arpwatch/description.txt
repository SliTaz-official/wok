Arpwatch maintains a database of Ethernet MAC addresses seen on the network, 
with their associated IP pairs. Alerts the system administrator via e-mail if 
any change happens, such as new station/activity, flip-flops, changed and 
re-used old addresses. 

Arpsnmp keeps track for ethernet/ip address pairings. It syslogs activity and 
reports certain changes via email. Arpsnmp reads information from a file 
(usually generated by snmpwalk(8)).

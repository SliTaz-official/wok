IPTState is a top-like interface to your netfilter connection-tracking table.

Using iptstate you interactively watch where traffic crossing your netfilter
iptables firewall is going, sort by various criteria, limit the view by
various criteria. But it doesn't stop there: as of version 2.2.0 you can even
delete states from the table!

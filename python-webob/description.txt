WebOb provides objects for HTTP requests and responses.
Specifically it does this by wrapping the WSGI request environment
and response status/headers/app_iter(body).

The request and response objects provide many conveniences for parsing
HTTP request and forming HTTP responses.
Both objects are read/write: as a result, WebOb is also a nice way to
create HTTP requests and parse HTTP responses.

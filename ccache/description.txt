Ccache is a compiler cache. It speeds up recompilation by caching
previous compilations and detecting when the same compilation is
being done again.

Features

- Supports GCC, Clang and other similar compilers.
- Works on Linux, macOS, other Unix-like operating systems and Windows.
- Understands C, C++, assembler, CUDA, Objective-C and Objective-C++.
- Supports secondary storage on HTTP, Redis or local filesystem,
  optionally sharding data to a server cluster.
- Supports fast "direct" and "depend" modes that don't rely on using
  the preprocessor.
- Supports compression using Zstandard.
- Checksums cache content using XXH3 to detect data corruption.
- Keeps statistics on hits and misses.
- Automatic cache size management.
- Easy installation.
- Low overhead.
- Support for rewriting absolute paths to relative in order to increase
  the cache hit ratio.
- Optionally uses file cloning (AKA "reflinks") where possible
  to avoid copies.
- Optionally uses hard links where possible to avoid copies.

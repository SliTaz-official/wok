Ardour is a multichannel hard disk recorder (HDR) and digital audio 
workstation (DAW). It can be used to control, record, edit and run complex 
audio setups.

Ardour supports pro-audio interfaces through the ALSA project, which provides 
high quality, well designed device drivers and API's for audio I/O under 
Linux. Any interface supported by ALSA can be used with Ardour. This includes 
the all-digital 26 channel RME Hammerfall, the Midiman Delta 1010 and many 
others.

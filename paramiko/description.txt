Paramiko is a pure-Python (2.7, 3.4+) implementation of the SSHv2 protocol,
providing both client and server functionality.
It provides the foundation for the high-level SSH library Fabric,
which is what we recommend you use for common client use-cases such
as running remote shell commands or transferring files.

Direct use of Paramiko itself is only intended for users who need
advanced or low-level primitives or want to run an in-Python sshd.

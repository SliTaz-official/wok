PatchELF is a simple utility for modifying existing ELF executables
and libraries.

In particular, it can do the following:

- Change the dynamic loader ("ELF interpreter") of executables
- Change the RPATH of executables and libraries
- Shrink the RPATH of executables and libraries
- Remove declared dependencies on dynamic libraries (DT_NEEDED entries)
- Add a declared dependency on a dynamic library (DT_NEEDED entries)
- Replace a declared dependency on a dynamic library with another one (DT_NEEDED)
- Change SONAME of a dynamic library

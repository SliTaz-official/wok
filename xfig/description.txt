It is freeware, and can be downloaded freely.

In xfig, figures may be drawn using objects such as circles, boxes, lines, spline curves, text, etc.
Those objects can be created, deleted, moved or modified.
Attributes such as colors or line styles can be selected in various ways.
For text, 35 fonts are available. Text can also include Latin-1 characters such as "ä" or "ç".
It is also possible to embed images in formats such as GIF, JPEG, EPS (PostScript), etc.

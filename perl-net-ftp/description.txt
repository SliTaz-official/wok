Net::FTP is a class implementing a simple FTP client in Perl as described
in RFC959.
It provides wrappers for the commonly used subset of the RFC959 commands.
If IO::Socket::IP or IO::Socket::INET6 is installed it also provides support
for IPv6 as defined in RFC2428.
And with IO::Socket::SSL installed it provides support for implicit FTPS
and explicit FTPS as defined in RFC4217.

The Net::FTP class is a subclass of Net::Cmd and (depending on avaibility)
of IO::Socket::IP, IO::Socket::INET6 or IO::Socket::INET.

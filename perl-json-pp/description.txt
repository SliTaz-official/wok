JSON::PP is a pure perl JSON decoder and encoder, and (almost) compatible
to much faster JSON::XS written by Marc Lehmann in C.
JSON::PP works as a fallback module when you use JSON module without
having installed JSON::XS.

Because of this fallback feature of JSON.pm, JSON::PP tries not to be
more JavaScript-friendly than JSON::XS (i.e. not to escape extra
characters such as U+2028 and U+2029, etc), in order for you not to lose
such JavaScript-friendliness silently when you use JSON.pm and install
JSON::XS for speed or by accident.
If you need JavaScript-friendly RFC7159-compliant pure perl module,
try JSON::Tiny, which is derived from Mojolicious web framework and is
also smaller and faster than JSON::PP.

JSON::PP has been in the Perl core since Perl 5.14, mainly for CPAN
toolchain modules to parse META.json.

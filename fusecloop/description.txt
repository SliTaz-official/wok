About SliTaz patch :

1- Add transparent support for accelerated knoppix, V0, V1 and V2 (current)
   format.

2- Add new V3 format
 * The index uses 32 bits lengths instead of 64 bits offsets.
 * The index move to the file end. The cloop creation tool holds the index in 
   memory instead of the datas. This reduce memory needs by 5000.
   $ genisoimage -R mydvd/ | create_compressed_fs 131072 > mydvd.cloop
  
3- Any format cloop can be converted to V2 format for knoppix compatibility.
   $ extract_compressed_fs file.cloop --convert-to-v2 > fileinv2.cloop

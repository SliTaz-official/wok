Fusecloop is FUSE mounter for compressed loop images.
These images can be found on Knoppix and Knoppix like CD's such as DSL.

About SliTaz patch :

1- Add transparent support for accelerated knoppix, V0, V1 and V2 (current)
   format.

2- Add new V3 format to build huge cloop images.
 * The index is compressed and uses 32 bits lengths instead of 64 bits offsets.
 * The index is moved to the file end. The cloop creation tool holds the index
   in memory instead of the datas. This reduces memory needs by 5000.
   $ genisoimage -R myDVD/ | create_compressed_fs 131072 > myDVD.cloop
  
3- Any format cloop can be converted to V2 format for knoppix compatibility.
   $ extract_compressed_fs myDVD.cloop --convert-to-v2 > myDVDinV2.cloop

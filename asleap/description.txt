This tool is released as a proof-of-concept to demonstrate weaknesses in
the LEAP and PPTP protocols.

LEAP is the Lightweight Extensible Authentication Protocol, intellectual
property of Cisco Systems, Inc.  LEAP is a security mechanism available
only on Cisco access points to perform authentication of end-users
and access points.  LEAP is written as a standard EAP-type, but is not
compliant with the 802.1X specification since the access point modifies
packets in transit, instead of simply passing them to a authentication
server (e.g. RADIUS).

PPTP is a Microsoft invention for deploying virual private networks (VPN).
PPTP uses a tunneling method to transfer PPP frames over an insecure
network such as a wireless LAN.  RFC 2637 documents the operation and
functionality of the PPTP protocol.


BACKGROUND

LEAP utilizes a modified MS-CHAPv2 challenge/response in order to
authenticate users on a wireless network.  The MS-CHAPv2 authentication
method has been clearly identified as a weak method of authentication
for several reasons.

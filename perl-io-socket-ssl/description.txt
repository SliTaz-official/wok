IO::Socket::SSL makes using SSL/TLS much easier by wrapping the necessary
functionality into the familiar IO::Socket interface and providing secure
defaults whenever possible.
This way, existing applications can be made SSL-aware without much effort,
at least if you do blocking I/O and don't use select or poll.

But, under the hood, SSL is a complex beast. So there are lots of methods
to make it do what you need if the default behavior is not adequate.
Because it is easy to inadvertently introduce critical security bugs or
just hard to debug problems, I would recommend studying the documentation
carefully.

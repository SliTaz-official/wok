Rsnapshot is a filesystem snapshot utility based on rsync.
Rsnapshot makes it easy to make periodic snapshots of local machines,
and remote machines over ssh.
The code makes extensive use of hard links whenever possible, to greatly
reduce the disk space required.

Depending on your configuration, it is quite possible to set up in just
a few minutes.
Files can be restored by the users who own them, without the root user
getting involved.

There are no tapes to change, so once it's set up, your backups can happen
automatically untouched by human hands.
And because rsnapshot only keeps a fixed (but configurable) number of
snapshots, the amount of disk space used will not continuously grow.

It is written entirely in perl with no module dependencies, and has been
tested with versions 5.004 through 5.16.3.
It should work on any reasonably modern UNIX compatible OS.

Rsnapshot was originally based on an article called Easy Automated
Snapshot-Style Backups with Linux and Rsync, by Mike Rubel.

Gparted is the GNOME Partition Editor for creating, reorganizing, and deleting
disk partitions.

A hard disk is usually subdivided into one or more partitions. These partitions
are normally not re-sizable (making one smaller and the adjacent one larger.)
Gparted makes it possible for you to take a hard disk and change the partition
organization, while preserving the partition contents.

More specifically, Gparted enables you to create, destroy, resize, move, check,
label, and copy partitions, and the file systems contained within. This is
useful for creating space for new operating systems, reorganizing disk usage,
and mirroring one partition with another (disk imaging).

Gparted can also be used with storage devices other than hard disks, such as
USB flash drives, and memory cards.

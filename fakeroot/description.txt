Gives a fake root environment, to remove the need to become root for
a package build.

Fakeroot runs a command in an environment where it appears to have
root privileges for file manipulation.
This is useful for allowing users to create archives (tar, ar,
.deb etc.) with files in them with root permissions or ownership.
Without fakeroot one would have to have root privileges to create the
constituent files of the archives with the correct permissions and
ownership, and then pack them up, or one would have to construct the
archives directly, without using the archiver.

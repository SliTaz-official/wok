Ario is a full featured client for MPD (Music Player Daemon). The interface 
used to browse the library is inspired by Rhythmbox but Ario aims to be much 
lighter and faster. It uses GTK2, avahi for MPD server detection and curl to 
download remote files (like cover arts and lyrics). Various plugins are 
provided like audioscrobbler/last.fm submission or multimedia keys support.

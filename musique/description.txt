Musique does its best to stay out of the way and keep you focused on the only
thing that really matters: Music.

Musique is great for those who appreciate its efficient simplicity. Consider
getting it as a gift for kids and other family members that may find other
players too complex and cumbersome.

  * Starts fast, very lightweight and can easily handle large collections.
  * Browse artist photos, album covers and folders too, so you can organize your
    music your way.
  * Immersive Info View you can switch to when listening. It contains valuable
    information about the current track, album and artist. When a new song
    starts, it will auto-update.
  * Automatically fixes misspellings and case in track titles, album titles and
    artist names, freeing you from the hassle of manually tagging your files.
  * Musique never ever modifies your files, it stores all of its data in its own
    database.
  * Supports scrobbling to Last.fm
  * Displays song lyrics stored inside your MP3s
  * Musique has just a single play queue. You can't go wrong, it's always there
    on the right.
  * Takes advantage of QuickTime on the Mac and VLC on Windows and thus supports
    all common audio formats.
  * Not an iTunes addon. It's a completely independent application that does one
    thing and does it well.
  * Translated to more than 20 languages including German, French, Spanish,
    Portuguese, Italian, Russian and Chinese.

Pyst2 consists of a set of interfaces and libraries to allow programming
of Asterisk from python.
The library currently supports AGI, AMI, and the parsing of Asterisk
configuration files.
The library also includes debugging facilities for AGI.

This project has been forked from pyst (http://sf.net/projects/pyst/)
because it was impossible for me to contact the project maintainer
(after several attempts), and I'd like to bring the project up-to-date,
fix bugs, and make it more usable overall.

Dcfldd is a modified version of GNU dd.
The major features added are:

* Hashing on-the-fly: dcfldd can hash the input data as it is
  being transferred, helping to ensure data integrity.
* Status output: dcfldd can update the user of its progress in
  terms of the amount of data transferred and how much longer
  operation will take.
* Flexible disk wipes: dcfldd can be used to wipe disks quickly
  and with a known pattern if desired.
* Image/wipe verify: dcfldd can verify that a target drive is a
  bit-for-bit match of the specified input file or pattern.
* Multiple outputs: dcfldd can output to multiple files or disks
  at the same time.
* Split output: dcfldd can split output to multiple files with
  more configurability than the split command.
* Piped output and logs: dcfldd can send all its log data and
  output to commands as well as files natively.

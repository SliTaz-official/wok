Vidalia is a cross-platform graphical controller for the Tor software,
built using the Qt framework.
Vidalia runs on most platforms supported by Qt 4.3 or later, including
Microsoft Windows, Apple OS X, and Linux or other Unix variants using
the X11 window system.
It was originally written by Matt Edman, and is currently maintained
by Tom√°s Touceda.

Vidalia lets you start and stop Tor, see how much bandwidth you are
consuming, see how many circuits you currently have active, see where
these circuits are connected on a global map, view messages from Tor
about its progress and current state, and let you configure your Tor
client, bridge, or relay with a simple interface.
Included in Vidalia is an extensive help system which helps you
understand all of the options available to you.
All of these features are translated into a large number of languages.

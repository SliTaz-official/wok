NOTICE

EggTrayIcon is slated for inclusion in Gtk+ at some point, which
is the reason the Gtk2::TrayIcon namespace. As all egg libs,
EggTrayIcon is not considered api stable and its not installed
as a shared object.

Enough about what it is not, Gtk2::TrayIcon is first and foremost
a simple way of giving a Gtk2 script access to the system tray.

System Trays are found in both KDE and Gnome.
But neither support the specification fully.

Gtk2::TrayIcon is a subclass of Gtk2::Plug and should be used as such.

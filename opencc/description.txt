Open Chinese Convert (OpenCC) is an opensource project for
conversions between Traditional Chinese, Simplified Chinese
and Japanese Kanji (Shinjitai).
It supports character-level and phrase-level conversion,
character variant conversion and regional idioms among
Mainland China, Taiwan and Hong Kong.
This is not a translation tool between Mandarin and Cantonese, etc.

HFS+ (HFS Plus, Hierarchical File System Plus) is a file system,
developed and used by AppleÂ®.

Hfsprescue is a program to recover files from a HFS+ formatted
partition. You can restore your files and directories even when
it's not possible to mount it with your operating system.
As side effect, the program also restores deleted files.
Your files and directories will be recovered to the directory
'restored/' in the directory where you start hfsprescue.
The damaged HFS+ file system will be opened as read only to not
change the data on the damaged drive.
So you need enough space to copy out the files from the HFS+
file system.

This program has no graphical user interface. You have to run it
from the command line.

Hfsprescue supports HFS+ compression (resource fork).

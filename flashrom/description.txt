Flashrom is a utility for identifying, reading, writing, verifying
and erasing flash chips.
It is designed to flash BIOS, EFI, coreboot, firmware, and optionROM
images on mainboards, network, graphics, and storage controller cards,
and various other programmer devices.

* Supports more than 476 flash chips, 291 chipsets, 500 mainboards,
  79 PCI devices, 17 USB devices and various parallel and serial
  port-based programmers.
* Supports parallel, LPC, FWH and SPI flash interfaces and various
  chip packages (DIP32, PLCC32, DIP8, SO8/SOIC8, TSOP32, TSOP40,
  TSOP48, BGA and more)
* No physical access needed, root access is sufficient (not needed
  for some programmers).
* No bootable floppy disk, bootable CD-ROM or other media needed.
* No keyboard or monitor needed. Simply reflash remotely via SSH.
* No instant reboot needed. Reflash your chip in a running system,
  verify it, be happy. The new firmware will be present next time
  you boot.
* Crossflashing and hotflashing is possible as long as the flash chips
  are electrically and logically compatible (same protocol).
  Great for recovery.
* Scriptability. Reflash a whole pool of identical machines at the same
  time from the command line. It is recommended to check flashrom output
  and error codes.
* Speed. flashrom is often much faster than most vendor flash tools.
* Portability. Supports DOS, Linux, FreeBSD (including Debian/kFreeBSD),
  NetBSD, OpenBSD, DragonFlyBSD, anything Solaris-like, Mac OS X, and
  other Unix-like OSes as well as GNU Hurd.

This distribution is an implementation of RFC-5905
"Network Time Protocol Version 4: Protocol and Algorithms
Specification".
NTP is widely used to synchronize a computer to Internet
time servers or other sources, such as a radio or
satellite receiver or telephone modem service.
It can also be used as a server for dependent clients.
It provides accuracies typically less than a millisecond
on LANs and up to a few milliseconds on WANs.
Typical NTP configurations utilize multiple redundant
servers and diverse network paths in order to achieve
high accuracy and reliability.

This distribution includes a simulation framework in which
substantially all the runtime NTP operations and most
features can be tested and evaluated.
This has been very useful in exploring in vitro response
to unusual circumstances or over time periods impractical
in vivo.
Details are on the Network Time Protocol (NTP) Simulator page.

The rTorrent bittorrent client uses ncurses and is ideal
for use with tmux, screen or dtach.
Alternatively, version 0.9.7+ has a built-in daemon mode
disabling the user interface, so you can only control it
via XMLRPC.
It supports saving of sessions, allows the user to add
and remove torrents, and much more.

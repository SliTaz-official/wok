nano - Nano's ANOther editor, an enhanced free Pico clone

nano is a small, free and friendly editor which aims to replace Pico, the
default editor included in the non-free Pine package. On top of copying Pico's
look and feel, nano also implements some missing (or disabled by default)
features in Pico, such as "search and replace" and "go to line and column
number".

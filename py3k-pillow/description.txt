The Python Imaging Library adds image processing capabilities to
the Python interpreter.

This library provides extensive file format support, an efficient
internal representation, and fairly powerful image processing
capabilities.

The core image library is designed for fast access to data stored
in a few basic pixel formats. It should provide a solid foundation
for a general image processing tool.

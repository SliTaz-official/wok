PTXdist is an easy-to-use Linux distribution build tool that allows you
to compose your embedded Linux out of a huge set of standard components
with a simple kernel-like configuration interface.

Despite being rather simple in the basic configuration PTXdist also
allows you to perform truly complex and very fine-grained customization
of the packages and system configuration you need.

Governments, organisations and corporations are putting more and more legal, 
moral and financial pressure on citizens, stifling free speech. High-profile 
sites like Wikileak can benefit from the Streisand effect, but it's rarely 
the case for smallers websites. But data must flow. The autoblog project aims 
at helping to automatically replicate articles all over the place, but on a 
smaller scale than what was done for Wikileaks. Think of it as an 
automated-Streisand effect.

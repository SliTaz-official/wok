"Accessx" is an open source utility to set and display all of the XKEYBOARD 
(XKB) AccessX features. It is designed to mimic the interface provided by the 
Sun and DEC "accessx" tool (now available as part of the official X11R6.6 
release of X from The X Consortium), and the similar SGI "accessx" tool. The 
original AccessX additions to X (via XKB) and the user interfaces to access 
that functionality came courtesy of Mark Novak, Will Walker, Robert Malone, 
Erik Fortune, and R. C. Underwood with X11R6.1. Many of the major UNIX vendors 
supplied a tool called "accessx" (though there were different "accessx" tools) 
to access the functionality provided by the AccessX parts of XKB. There are a 
few other open source tools for manipulating AccessX, but ours provides an 
interface and file format similar to the popular Sun tool.

This software provides support for the Tag Image File
Format (TIFF), a widely used format for storing image
data.
The latest version of the TIFF specification is
available on-line in several different formats, as are
a number of Technical Notes (TTN's).

Included in this software distribution is a library,
libtiff, for reading and writing TIFF, a small
collection of tools for doing simple manipulations of
TIFF images on UNIX systems, and documentation on the
library and tools.
A small assortment of TIFF-related software for UNIX
that has been contributed by others is also included.

The library, along with associated tool programs,
should handle most of your needs for reading and
writing TIFF images on 32- and 64-bit machines.

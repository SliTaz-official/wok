Grace is a WYSIWYG 2D plotting tool, a descendant of ACE/gr, also known as Xmgr.
It has a convenient point-and-click graphical user interface, allows precise
control of graph features, and does instant plot refresh. Grace enables you to
reach true publication quality.
Grace can export graphics to vector formats ((E)PS, MIF, and SVG) as well
as bitmap ones (PNG, PNM, and JPEG). It does a precise rendering of Type1 fonts.
Grace manages unlimited numbers of graph, of curves in each graph, and unlimited
data size. It has much flexibility in graphing options (colors, symbols, line
and text styles).
One of the prominent features is integrated data manipulation tools: versatile
curve fitting, FFT, histograms, convolution... (This version is compiled
without support for the NetCDF data format.) Grace can be scripted with its
own language, and also offers library functions to control it from a C or
Fortran application.

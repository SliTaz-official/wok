TazPkg is a small but powerful packages manager for SliTaz GNU/Linux and other
UNIX-like operating systems. It uses a *.tazpkg package generally built by
Cookutils with a receipt found in the wok. More information can be found in the
SliTaz Cookbook and the manual.

TazPkg is entirely built from scratch using shell script. TazPkg is distributed
under the free GNU license GPL V3.

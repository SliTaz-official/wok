# This file contains the options used in the Thunderbird build. You may
# need to specify additional options for your specific build needs.
# Use the information provided by running './configure --help' to
# help you determine if you need to add any additional options.
# Some additional options can be added by uncommenting the examples
# in this file or adding options by inserting a line containing
# 'ac_add_options --some-option-you-need'.  Be aware that some accepted
# options, such as '--with-system-bz2', do not affect the build.

# line below.
mk_add_options MOZ_OBJDIR=@TOPSRCDIR@/../thunderbird-build

# These options are used so that the Xulrunner binaries are linked to
# the system-installed copies of the specified libraries instead of
# the source tree code which may not be the most recent versions.
# With the exception of libsqlite3, the libraries are statically linked.

# (Options to use system installed libraries)
# Using the shipped version of libsqlite3 has been reported to cause
# problems with other applications which were using sqlite3.

# (options to add extra parts of the package)
# This option causes the installed binaries to have the official

# means you get a popup EULA when you first run thunderbird.

# the Firefox binaries.  This used to be required for mozab support in
# OpenOffice, however, is now deprecated.
ac_add_options --enable-ldap

# This option is used so that the debugging symbols are removed from

ConfigObj is a simple but powerful config file reader and writer: an ini file
round tripper. Its main feature is that it is very easy to use, with a
straightforward programmer's interface and a simple syntax for config files. It
has lots of other features though:

  * Nested sections (subsections), to any level
  * List values
  * Multiple line values
  * Full Unicode support
  * String interpolation (substitution)
  * Integrated with a powerful validation system
    - including automatic type checking/conversion
    - and allowing default values
    - repeated sections
  * All comments in the file are preserved
  * The order of keys/sections is preserved
  * Powerful unrepr mode for storing/retrieving Python data-types

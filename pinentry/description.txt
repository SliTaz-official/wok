Curses Pinentry
---------------

The curses pinentry supports colors if the terminal does. The colors can be
specified by the --colors=FG,BG,SO option, which sets the foreground,
background and standout colors respectively. The standout color is used for
error messages. Colors can be named by any of "black", "red", "green",
"yellow", "blue", "magenta", "cyan" and "white". The foreground and standout
color can be prefixed by "bright-", "bright", "bold-" and "bold", and any of
these prefixes has the same effect of making the color bolder or brighter. Two
special color names are defined as well: "default" chooses the default color,
and "none" disables use of colors. The name "none" is only meaningful for the
standout color and in this case a reversed effect is used for error messages.
For the other colors, disabling colors means the same as using the defaults.
The default colors are as follows:

  * Foreground: Terminal default
  * Background: Terminal default
  * Standout:   Bright red

Note that color support is limited by the capabilities of the display terminal.
Some color combinations can be very difficult to read, and please know that
colors are perceived differently by different people.

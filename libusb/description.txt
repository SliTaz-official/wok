Libusb is a C library that provides generic access to USB devices.
It is intended to be used by developers to facilitate the production
of applications that communicate with USB hardware.

It is portable: Using a single cross-platform API, it provides access
to USB devices on Linux, macOS, Windows, etc.

It is user-mode: No special privilege or elevation is required for the
application to communicate with a device.

It is version-agnostic: All versions of the USB protocol, from 1.0 to
3.1 (latest), are supported.

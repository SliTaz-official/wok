Net::Server is an extensible, generic Perl server engine.

Net::Server attempts to be a generic server as in Net::Daemon and
NetServer::Generic.
It includes with it the ability to run as an inetd process
(Net::Server::INET), a single connection server (Net::Server or
Net::Server::Single), a forking server (Net::Server::Fork),
a preforking server which maintains a constant number of preforked
children (Net::Server::PreForkSimple), or as a managed preforking
server which maintains the number of children based on server load
(Net::Server::PreFork).
In all but the inetd type, the server provides the ability to connect
to one or to multiple server ports.

The additional server types are made possible via "personalities" or
sub classes of the Net::Server.
By moving the multiple types of servers out of the main Net::Server
class, the Net::Server concept is easily extended to other types
(in the near future, we would like to add a "Thread" personality).

Net::Server borrows several concepts from the Apache Webserver.
Net::Server uses "hooks" to allow custom servers such as SMTP, HTTP,
POP3, etc. to be layered over the base Net::Server class.
In addition the Net::Server::PreFork class borrows concepts of
min_start_servers, max_servers, and min_waiting servers.
Net::Server::PreFork also uses the concept of an flock serialized
accept when accepting on multiple ports (PreFork can choose between
flock, IPC::Semaphore, and pipe to control serialization).

Nmap ("Network Mapper") is a utility for network discovery and security 
auditing. Many systems and network administrators also find it useful for tasks 
such as network inventory, managing service upgrade schedules, and monitoring 
host or service uptime. Nmap uses raw IP packets in novel ways to determine what
hosts are available on the network, what services (application name and version)
those hosts are offering, what operating systems (and OS versions) they are 
running, what type of packet filters/firewalls are in use, and dozens of other 
characteristics. It was designed to rapidly scan large networks, but works fine 
against single hosts.

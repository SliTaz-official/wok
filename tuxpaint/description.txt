Tux Paint is a free, award-winning drawing program for children ages 3 to 12.
It combines an easy-to-use interface, fun sound effects, and an encouraging
cartoon mascot who guides children as they use the program.

Kids are presented with a blank canvas and a variety of drawing tools to help
them be creative. Along with paintbrush, shapes and text, Tux Paint includes
a "stamp" feature to add pre-drawn or photographic imagery to pictures, and
a set of "magic tools" that provide filter effects (like blur, tint and waves)
and interesting drawing tools (like train tracks, bubbles and grass).

GNU/EDMA

GNU EDMA is the Entorno de Desarrollo Modular y Abierto, or in English
the Modular and Open Development Environment (named MODE by Russel Reed
in the first GNU/EDMA documentation translations). The name is in Spanish
because GNU EDMA has been developed by GPI (Grupo de Procesado de Imagen
or Image Processing Group) at Vigo University, Spain.

GNU EDMA provides an Object Oriented Component-Based development
environment to build modular and evolving applications as well as highly
reusable components. To achieve this, GNU EDMA shares features of OO
programming languages and component based systems in a loosely coupled
environment.

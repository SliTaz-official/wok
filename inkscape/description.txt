Inkscape is an illustration editor which has everything needed to create
professional-quality computer art. You can use it to make diagrams and
illustrations, technical drawings, web graphics, clip art, icons and logos.
A collection of hands-on tutorials show you how to combine lines, shapes and
text of different types and styles to build up a picture.
A selection of powerful vector graphics editing tools comes as standard. There
is excellent support for paths, gradients, layers, alpha transparency and text
flow control. An extensive library of filters allow you to apply realistic
effects and extensions allow you to work with bitmaps, barcodes and printing
marks, amongst other things.
Most of the common vector formats are supported, including PDF, Adobe
Illustrator and AutoCAD files, and it has unrivalled support for the SVG web
graphics standard.

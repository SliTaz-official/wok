The Intel Processor Microcode Update (MCU) Package provides a mechanism
to release updates for security advisories and functional issues,
including errata.
In addition, MCUs are responsible for starting the SGX enclave (on
processors that support the SGX feature), implementing complex behaviors
(such as assists), and more.
The preferred method to apply MCUs is using the system BIOS.
For a subset of Intel's processors, the MCU can also be updated at
runtime using the operating system.
The Intel Microcode Package shared here contains updates for those
processors that support OS loading of MCUs.

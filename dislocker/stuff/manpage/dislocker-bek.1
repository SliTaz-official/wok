BEK file is a BitLocker Encryption Key. BitLocker Drive Encryption is a full
disk encryption feature included with the Microsoft's Windows versions Vista
to 10. It is designed to protect data by providing encryption for entire
volumes.

The software works with driver composed of a library, with multiple binaries
using this library. Decrypting the partition, you have to give it a mount
point where, once keys are decrypted, a file named dislocker-file appears.
This file is a virtual NTFS partition, so you can mount it as any NTFS
partition and then read from or write to it. Writing to the NTFS virtual
file will change the underlying BitLocker partition content.

This tool is useful in cryptography managing and forensics investigations.

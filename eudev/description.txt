Eudev is a fork of systemd-udev with the goal of obtaining better
compatibility with existing software such as OpenRC and Upstart,
older kernels, various toolchains, and anything else required by
users and various distributions.

In specific it tries to avoid glibc-specific functions and
gcc-specific constructs by sticking to C99 while tracking closely
the systemd-udev developments.

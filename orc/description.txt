Orc is basically a simplified assembly language for data processing
(no loops, jumps etc.), it's supposed to map to SIMD instructions on
various architectures curently there are two things:

- liborc, which is a JIT compiler that will at run-time take orc code
  (in some byte format) and generate machine code for the architecture
  in question on the fly and then execute that whenever there's a
  function call
- we have C backup functions as .c files in the gstreamer source code,
  which are also compiled in when orc can't compile some code (for
  various reasons), or liborc is not available, then the C backup
  function will be used that's the current state of things.

Type design of Greek fonts was until very recently exclusively
imported from Western European foundries.
During the Rennaissance the typecutters followed the late
byzantine hand, which was full of ligatures and abbrevations
of letters. This practice continued until the Age of Enlightenment,
when the practical simplification of the Greek typecase was
followed by a quest for an "ideal" Greek type design under the
influence of Romanticism.
The digital redesigns of several historic fonts offered here
chart this historic evolution of Greek type design.

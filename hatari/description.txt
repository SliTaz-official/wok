Hatari is an Atari ST/STE/TT/Falcon emulator for GNU/Linux,
BSD, Mac OS X, Windows and other systems which are supported
by the SDL library.
The Atari ST was a 16/32 bit computer system which was first
released by Atari in 1985.
Using the Motorola 68000 CPU, it was a very popular computer
having quite a lot of CPU power at that time.
Unlike many other Atari ST emulators which try to give you a
good environment for running GEM applications, Hatari tries
to emulate the hardware of a ST as close as possible so that
it is able to run most of the old ST games and demos.

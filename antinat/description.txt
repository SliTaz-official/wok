Antinat is a flexible SOCKS server and client library for writing proxy-based 
applications. It supports SOCKS 4, SOCKS 4a, SOCKS 5, authentication, CHAP, 
XML firewalling, Win32, server chaining, and UDP. It also contains very 
experimental IPv6 support.

SOCKS can be used to overcome some limitations of NAT, including facilites 
for allowing connectbacks and server-side DNS. Antinat aims to be fully 
standards compliant, feature rich, and have a solid API for writing 
standards-compliant client applications.

Connections are filtered by applying XML rules, which allow for very 
fine-grained control. You can filter out on the basis of addresses, ports, 
users, socks version, the operation requested, how the user was 
authenticated, and where user credentials came from.

Note: Antinat is not malware! Antinat, like any SOCKS server, enables you to 
traverse network boundaries once you have access to a machine. Whether this 
is malicious or not depends on who installed and configured the software. If 
you're on this website looking to install and configure this software, that 
means it's no more malicious than you.

nothing. We can't read your mind. We can't. Honest.

ScrollZ is an advanced IRC client based on ircII.
It incorporates many useful features found in all sorts
of scripts.
The main difference between these scripts and ScrollZ is
the code - whereas ircII scripts take a lot of disk and
memory space and run slow, ScrollZ only takes a couple
of extra kilobytes compared to stock ircII client yet
runs faster than any ircII script. This was accomplished
by using C code instead of ircII scripting language.
This reduces memoryand CPU usage and code tends to run
way faster.

Antimicro is a graphical program used to map keyboard keys and mouse controls 
to a gamepad. This program is useful for playing PC games using a gamepad 
that do not have any form of built-in gamepad support. However, you can use 
this program to control any desktop application with a gamepad; on Linux, 
this means that your system has to be running an X environment in order to 
run this program.

This program is currently supported under various Linux distributions, 
Windows (Vista and later), and FreeBSD. At the time of writing this, 
antimicro works in Windows XP but, since Windows XP is no longer supported, 
running the program in Windows XP will not be officially supported. However, 
efforts will be made to not intentionally break compatibility with Windows 
XP.

Also, FreeBSD support will be minimal for now. I don't use BSD on a daily 
basis so the main support for FreeBSD is being offered by Anton. He has 
graciously made a port of antimicro for FreeBSD that you can find at the 
following URL: http://www.freshports.org/x11/antimicro/.

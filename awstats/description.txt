**AWStats** is a free powerful and featureful tool that generates advanced 
web, streaming, ftp or mail server statistics, graphically. This log analyzer 
works as a CGI or from command line and shows you all possible information 
your log contains, in few graphical web pages. It uses a partial information 
file to be able to process large log files, often and quickly. It can analyze 
log files from all major server tools like Apache log files (NCSA 
combined/XLF/ELF log format or common/CLF log format), WebStar, IIS (W3C log 
format) and a lot of other web, proxy, wap, streaming servers, mail servers 
and some ftp servers.

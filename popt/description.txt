Popt was heavily influenced by the getopt() and getopt_long() functions, but it
allows more powerful argument expansion. It can parse arbitrary argv[] style
arrays and automatically set variables based on command line arguments. It also
allows command line arguments to be aliased via configuration files and includes
utility functions for parsing arbitrary strings into argv[] arrays using
shell-like rules.

GHex is a simple binary editor. It lets users view and edit a binary file in 
both hex and ascii with a multiple level undo/redo mechanism. Features include 
find and replace functions, conversion between binary, octal, decimal and 
hexadecimal values, and use of an alternative, user-configurable MDI concept 
that lets users edit multiple documents with multiple views of each.

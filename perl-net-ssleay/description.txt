This module provides Perl bindings for libssl (an SSL/TLS API) and
libcrypto (a cryptography API).

Net::SSLeay module basically comprise of:

- High level functions for accessing web servers (by using HTTP/HTTPS)
- Low level API (mostly mapped 1:1 to openssl's C functions)
- Convenience functions (related to low level API but with more perl
  friendly interface)

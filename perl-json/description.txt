This module is a thin wrapper for JSON::XS-compatible modules with
a few additional features.
All the backend modules convert a Perl data structure to a JSON text
and vice versa.
This module uses JSON::XS by default, and when JSON::XS is not available,
falls back on JSON::PP, which is in the Perl core since 5.14.
If JSON::PP is not available either, this module then falls back on
JSON::backportPP (which is actually JSON::PP in a different .pm file)
bundled in the same distribution as this module.
You can also explicitly specify to use Cpanel::JSON::XS, a fork of
JSON::XS by Reini Urban.

All these backend modules have slight incompatibilities between them,
including extra features that other modules don't support, but as long as
you use only common features (most important ones are described below),
migration from backend to backend should be reasonably easy.
For details, see each backend module you use.

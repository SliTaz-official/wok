This is nss-pam-ldapd, a Name Service Switch (NSS) module and Pluggable 
Authentication Module (PAM) that allows your LDAP server to provide user 
account, group, host name, alias, netgroup, and basically any other information 
that you would normally get from /etc flat files or NIS. It also allows you to 
do authentication to an LDAP server.

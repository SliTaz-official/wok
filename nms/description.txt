This project provides a command line tool called nms that recreates
the famous data decryption effect seen on screen in the 1992 hacker
movie Sneakers.

This command works on piped data. Pipe any ASCII or UTF-8 text to nms,
and it will apply the Hollywood effect, initially showing encrypted
data, then starting a decryption sequence to reveal the original
plain-text characters.

Lazarus is a Delphi compatible cross-platform IDE for Free Pascal. It includes
LCL which is more or less compatible with Delphi's VCL. Free Pascal is a GPL'ed
compiler that runs on Linux, Win32, OS/2, 68K and more. Free Pascal is designed
to be able to understand and compile Delphi syntax, which is OOP. Lazarus is
the part of the missing puzzle that will allow you to develop Delphi like
programs in all of the above platforms. Unlike Java which strives to be a write
once run anywhere, Lazarus and Free Pascal strives for write once compile
anywhere. Since the exact same compiler is available on all of the above
platforms it means you don't need to do any recoding to produce identical
products for different platforms.

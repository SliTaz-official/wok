xterm is a terminal emulator for the X Window System. It provides DEC VT102 and
Tektronix 4014 compatible terminals for programs that cannot use the window
system directly. This version implements ISO/ANSI colors and most of the control
sequences used by DEC VT220 terminals.

This package provides commands: xterm, which is the traditional terminal
emulator; uxterm, which is a wrapper around xterm that is intelligent about
locale settings (especially those which use the UTF-8 character encoding).

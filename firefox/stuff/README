Tazwok build Firefox from the official Mozila source code, we use a .mozconfig
file to set all configure options. SliTaz firefox.mozconfig is copied in the
mozilla source code with the command 'tazwok cook'. So if you want to make
some changes, edit firefox.mozconfig.

On SliTaz the Mozilla default icons are removed (65 Ko) and a resized (48x48)
mozicon is put in /usr/share/pixmaps.

browserconfig.properties is used to set www.slitaz.org for the default home
page, this file goes in /usr/lib/firefox-$VERSION with the bookmarks file.

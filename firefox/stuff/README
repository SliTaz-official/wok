We build Firefox from the official Mozila source code, we use a mozconfig
file to set all configure options. SliTaz firefox mozconfig is copied in the
mozilla source code with the command 'tazwok cook'. So if you want to make
some changes, edit stuff/mozconfig.

On SliTaz the Mozilla default icons are removed (65 Ko) and a resized (48x48)
mozicon is put in /usr/share/pixmaps.

distribution.ini is used to set bookmarks and www.slitaz.org for the default
home page, this file goes in /usr/lib/firefox-$VERSION/distribution/

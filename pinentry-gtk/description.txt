This is a collection of simple PIN or passphrase entry dialogs which utilize
the Assuan protocol as described by the aegypten project; see
http://www.gnupg.org/aegypten/ for details.

There are programs for different toolkits available. This package contains
program for GTK+ V2.0. The GTK+ and Qt pinentries can fall back to curses mode.

Some of the code is taken from Robert Bihlmeyer's Quintuple-Agent. For security
reasons, all internationalization has been removed. The client is expected to
tell the PIN entry the text strings to be displayed.

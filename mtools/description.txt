Mtools is a collection of utilities to access MS-DOS disks
from GNU and Unix without mounting them.
It supports Win'95 style long file names, OS/2 Xdf disks and
2m disks (store up to 1992k on a high density 3 1/2 disk).
In addition to file access, it supports many FAT-specific
features:
volume labels, FAT-specific file attributes (hidden, system, ...),
"bad block" map maintenance, access to remote floppy drives,
Iomega ZIP disk protection, "secure" erase, display of file's
on-disk layout, etc.

Mtools' configurator file is stored in /etc/mtools.conf

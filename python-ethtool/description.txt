Python bindings for the ethtool kernel interface

The Python ethtool module allows querying and partially controlling
network interfaces, driver, and hardware settings.

Warning

This is the new upstream for python-ethtool maintained by Fedora's Python SIG.
We ported it to Python 3 and only maintain it for the current tools to keep
working. No new development is happening.
This is a deprecated package.
If you are considering to start using this, please don't.
We recommend netifaces instead.

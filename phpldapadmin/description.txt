PhpLDAPadmin is a web based LDAP data management tool for system administrators.
It is commonly known and referred by many as "PLA".

A primary goal of PLA is to be as intuitive as possible - so it is certainly
possible for end users to use it as well, for example, to manage their data in
an LDAP server.

PLA is designed to be compliant with LDAP RFCs, enabling it to be used with any
LDAP server.

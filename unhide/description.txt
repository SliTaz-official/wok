Unhide is a forensic tool to find hidden processes and TCP/UDP ports
by rootkits, LKMs or by another hiding technique.

Detecting hidden processes. Implements six main techniques

1- Compare /proc vs /bin/ps output
2- Compare info gathered from /bin/ps with info gathered by walking
   through the procfs.
3- Compare info gathered from /bin/ps with info gathered from
   syscalls (syscall scanning).
4- Full PIDs space occupation (PIDs bruteforcing).
5- Compare /bin/ps output vs /proc, procfs walking and syscall.
   Reverse search, verify that all threads seen by ps are also seen
   in the kernel.
6- Quick compare /proc, procfs walking and syscall vs /bin/ps output.
   It's about 20 times faster than tests 1, 2 and 3 but maybe give
   more false positives.

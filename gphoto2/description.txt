GPhoto2 is a free, redistributable, ready to use set of digital camera
software applications for Unix-like systems, written by a whole team
of dedicated volunteers around the world.
It supports more than 2700 cameras and media players.

Newer Libgphoto2 versions also support Media Transfer Protocol (MTP)
based media players since their communications protocol is based on
the Picture Transfer Protocol (PTP).

Dillo is a minimalistic web browser particularly intended for older or slower 
computers and embedded systems. It supports only plain HTML/XHTML (with basic 
CSS rendering) and images over HTTP; scripting is ignored entirely. Due to its 
small size, it is the browser of choice in several space-conscious Linux 
distributions.

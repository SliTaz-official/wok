wxWidgets is a free and open source cross-platform C++ framework for writing
advanced GUI applications using native controls.

wxWidgets allows you to write native-looking GUI applications for all the major
desktop platforms and also helps with abstracting the differences in the non-GUI
aspects between them. It is free for the use in both open source and commercial
applications, comes with the full, easy to read and modify, source and extensive
documentation and a collection of more than a hundred examples.

You can learn more about wxWidgets at <http://www.wxwidgets.org/> and read its
documentation online at <http://docs.wxwidgets.org/3.0.2/>

This is a window manager for X. It is similar in many respects to such 
popular packages as Window Maker, Enlightenment, and FVWM2. You might be 
interested in this package if you are tired of window managers that are a 
heavy drain on your system resources, but you still want an attractive and 
modern-looking interface.

LXLauncher is a GUI application for the Lightweight X11 Desktop Environment
(LXDE).

It is a Easy-Mode launcher for netbooks and subnotebooks like the EeePC.

It's standard-compliant and desktop-independent. It follows freedesktop.org
specs, so newly added applications will automatically show up in the launcher,
and vice versa for the removed ones.

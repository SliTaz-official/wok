fig2dev from transfig package is needed to export or print a Fig file.
The post-processor fig2dev converts the Fig file to the desired output language.
For printing, this is PostScript. For exporting, there are a dozen or so languages,
including PostScript, EPS, LaTeX, MetaFont, and bitmap formats such as GIF, JPEG,
PPM and several others. See the Language description of the Exporting section.
This means that you must have transfig installed on your system along with xfig.

psutil (process and system utilities) is a cross-platform library for
retrieving information on running processes and system utilization
(CPU, memory, disks, network, sensors) in Python.
It is useful mainly for system monitoring, profiling and limiting process
resources and management of running processes.
It implements many functionalities offered by classic UNIX command line
tools such as ps, top, iotop, lsof, netstat, ifconfig, free and others.

Supported Python versions are 2.6, 2.7, 3.4+ and PyPy.

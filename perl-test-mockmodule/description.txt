Test::MockModule lets you temporarily redefine subroutines in other packages
for the purposes of unit testing.

A Test::MockModule object is set up to mock subroutines for a given module.
The object remembers the original subroutine so it can be easily restored.
This happens automatically when all MockModule objects for the given module
go out of scope, or when you unmock() the subroutine.

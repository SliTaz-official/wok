File::RsyncP is a perl implementation of an Rsync client.
It is compatible with Rsync 2.5.5 - 2.6.3 (protocol versions 26-28).
It can send or receive files, either by running rsync on the remote
machine, or connecting to an rsyncd deamon on the remote machine.

What use is File::RsyncP?
The main purpose is that File::RsyncP separates all file system I/O
into a separate module, which can be replaced by any module of your
own design. This allows rsync interfaces to non-filesystem data
types (eg: databases) to be developed with relative ease.

File::RsyncP was initially written to provide an Rsync interface for
BackupPC, http://backuppc.sourceforge.net.
See BackupPC for programming examples.

File::RsyncP does not yet provide a command-line interface that
mimics native Rsync.
Instead it provides an API that makes it possible to write simple
scripts that talk to rsync or rsyncd.

The File::RsyncP::FileIO module contains the default file system
access functions. File::RsyncP::FileIO may be subclassed or replaced
by a custom module to provide access to non-filesystem data types.

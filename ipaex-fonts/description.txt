IPA has been providing “IPA Font”^1 series from 2003, which IPA has all rights,
and released “IPAex Mincho” and “IPAex Gothic” in February 2010 for common
Japanese documentation.

Main features of IPAex Fonts are as follows:

  * Fixed width for Japanese characters like Kana and Kanji
  * Proportional width for Western characters
  * Best balance for Japanese documentation mixed with Western characters

When old versions are needed for backward compatibility, “IPA Mincho” and “IPA
Gothic” for fixed width usage, “IPA P Mincho” and “IPA P Gothic” for
proportional width usage has been still provided.

”IPAex Font” series (Ver.001 and upper) and “IPA Font” series (Ver.003 and
upper) is able to use with the agreement to “IPA Open Font License”, which is
consistent with international business practice and endorsed by Open Source
Initiative (OSI) as confirmed license with Open Source Definition (OSD).

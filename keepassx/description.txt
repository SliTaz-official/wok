KeePassX is an application for people with extremly high demands on 
secure personal data management. It has a light interface, is cross 
platform and published under the terms of the GNU General Public License.

KeePassX saves many different information e.g. user names, passwords, 
urls, attachments and comments in one single database. For a better 
management user-defined titles and icons can be specified for each 
single entry. Furthermore the entries are sorted in groups, which 
are customizable as well. The integrated search function allows to 
search in a single group or the complete database.
KeePassX offers a little utility for secure password generation. 
The password generator is very customizable, fast and easy to use. 
Especially someone who generates passwords frequently will appreciate 
this feature.

The complete database is always encrypted either with AES (alias Rijndael) 
or Twofish encryption algorithm using a 256 bit key. Therefore the saved 
information can be considered as quite safe. KeePassX uses a database 
format that is compatible with KeePass Password Safe. This makes the use 
of that application even more favourable.

Originally KeePassX was called KeePass/L for Linux since it was a port 
of Windows password manager Keepass Password Safe. After KeePass/L became 
a cross platform application the name was not appropriate anymore and 
therefore, on 22 March 2006 it has been changed.

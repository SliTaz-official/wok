DBD::SQLite is a Perl DBI driver for SQLite, that includes the
entire thing in the distribution.
So in order to get a fast transaction capable RDBMS working for
your perl project you simply have to install this module,
and nothing else.

SQLite supports the following features:

- Implements a large subset of SQL92
- A complete DB in a single disk file
- Atomic commit and rollback
- Extensible

There's lots more to it, so please refer to the docs on the SQLite
web page for SQL details.
Also refer to DBI for details on how to use DBI itself.
The API works like every DBI module does.
However, currently many statement attributes are not implemented or
are limited by the typeless nature of the SQLite database.

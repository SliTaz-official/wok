Slurm started as a FreeBSD port of the Linux ppp link monitor called
pppstatus by Gabriel Montenegro.
Hendrik Scholz ripped of the ppp dependent parts and the email checks
to turn in into a generic network load monitor for *BSD, Linux, HP-UX
and Solaris.

Features:
- "realtime" traffic statistics
- three graph modes: combined RX and TX and two split views
- can monitor any network device
- curses ASCII graphics
- ASCII theme support

xmlto
-----

Utility `xmlto` is a simple shell script for converting XML files to various
formats. It serves as easy to use command line frontend to make fine output
without remembering many long options and searching for the syntax of the
backends.

At the moment it supports conversion from docbook, xhtml1 and fo format to
various output formats (awt, fo, htmlhelp, javahelp, mif, pdf, svg, xhtml, dvi,
html, html-nochunks, man , pcl, ps, txt, xhtml-nochunks).

Some output formats may be unavailable if you use don't have all prerequisities
installed, as xmlto uses backends (xsltproc, passivetex/fop/dblatex) for
processing.

You could check the documentation online at
<https://fedorahosted.org/xmlto/wiki/xmlto>
(or generate the offline version with xmlto from doc/xmlto.xml sources).

If you received xmlto as a part of distribution, you should already have
xmlto(1) manpage on your machine.

`xmlif` utility filters XML according to conditionalizing markup. This can be
useful for formatting one of several versions of a XML document depending on
conditions passed to the command.

You could check the documentation online at
<https://fedorahosted.org/xmlto/wiki/xmlif>
(or generate the offline version with xmlto from doc/xmlif.xml sources).

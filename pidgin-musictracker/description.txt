Notes:
  * To show now playing in MSN personal status messages you must be using pidgin
    2.5.0 or later (or msn-pecan). If you have ever had musictracker 0.4.1 or
    earlier installed, you must reinstall pidgin for MSN personal status
    messages to work correctly. (See  issue 15 , FAQ #2)
  * See the wiki page for details on configuring your player and musictracker
    to work together.

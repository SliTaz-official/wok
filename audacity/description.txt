**Audacity** is a graphical audio editor.

Audacity is primarily an interactive, graphical editor, not a batch-processing
tool. Whilst there is a basic batch processing tool it is experimental and
incomplete. If you need to batch-process audio or do simple edits from the
command line, using **sox** or **ecasound** driven by a bash script will be much
more powerful than audacity.

Audacity supports two types of plug-ins on Unix: LADSPA and Nyquist plug-ins.

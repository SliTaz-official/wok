LibGTop is a library to get system specific data such as CPU and
Memory Usage and information about running Processes.
Even if LibGTop is a part of the GNOME desktop environment, the
main interface of LibGTop is totally independent from any particular
desktop environment, so you can also use it as a standalone library
in any piece of GPLed software.

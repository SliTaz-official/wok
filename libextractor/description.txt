GNU Libextractor is a library used to extract meta data from files.
The goal is to provide developers of file-sharing networks, browsers
or WWW-indexing bots with a universal library to obtain simple
keywords and meta data to match against queries and to show to users
instead of only relying on filenames.
Libextractor contains the shell command extract that, similar to the
well-known file command, can extract meta data from a file and print
the results to stdout.

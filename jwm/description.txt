JWM is a light-weight window manager for the X11 Window System.
JWM is written in C and uses only Xlib at a minimum.
Because of its small footprint, JWM makes a good window manager
for older computers and less powerful systems, such as the
Raspberry Pi, though it is perfectly capable of running on modern
systems.

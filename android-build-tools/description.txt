Android SDK Build-Tools is a component of the Android SDK required for 
building Android apps. It's installed in the <sdk>/build-tools/ directory.

You should always keep your Build Tools component updated by downloading the 
latest version using the Android SDK Manager. By default, the Android SDK 
uses the most recent downloaded version of the Build Tools. If your projects 
depend on older versions of the Build Tools, the SDK Manager allows you to 
download and maintain separate versions of the tools for use with those 
projects.

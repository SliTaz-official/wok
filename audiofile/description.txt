The Audio File Library handles reading and writing audio files in many common 
formats.

Key goals of the Audio File Library are file format transparency and data format
transparency. The same calls for opening a file, accessing and manipulating 
audio metadata (e.g. sample rate, sample format, textual information, MIDI 
parameters), and reading and writing sample data will work with any supported 
audio file format.

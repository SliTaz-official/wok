The Xfce Notify Daemon (xfce4-notifyd for short) is a smallish program that
implements the "server-side" portion of the Freedesktop desktop notifications
specification. Applications that wish to pop up a notification bubble in a
standard way can implicitly make use of xfce4-notifyd to do so by sending
standard messages over D-Bus using the org.freedesktop.Notifications interface.

It's recommended use xfce4-notifyd with a compositing manager running; in that
case xfce4-notifyd will look a bit nicer and will be semi-transparent and will
fade out, and other nice pretty things. This isn't required by any means, of
course.


Configuration:

Run xfce4-notifyd-config to display the settings dialog. There aren't any other
tunables; if you don't see it in the settings dialog, it's not changeable.


Theming:

Xfce4-notifyd uses gtk's standard theming system. You can create new themes by
creating a normal gtkrc file. See the example included themes for details of
how to reference the various widgets present in a normal notification dialog.
You'll want to put your gtkrc file in $HOME/.themes/THEMENAME/xfce4-notify-4.0
and then start up the configuration dialog to set the theme. If you think
you've come up with a cool theme, feel free to send it to the author, and he'll
be happy to include it in the next release. For themes shipped with
xfce4-notifyd, author requires all parts of them to be redistributable under
the terms of a license compatible with the GPLv2.

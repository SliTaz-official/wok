Apache FOP (Formatting Objects Processor) is a print formatter
driven by XSL formatting objects (XSL-FO) and an output independent
formatter.
It is a Java application that reads a formatting object (FO) tree
and renders the resulting pages to a specified output.
Output formats currently supported include PDF, PS, PCL, AFP, XML
(area tree representation), Print, AWT and PNG, and to a lesser
extent, RTF and TXT. The primary output target is PDF.

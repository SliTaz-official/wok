Electric Sheep is a collaborative abstract artwork founded by Scott Draves. It's
run by thousands of people all over the world, and can be installed on any 
ordinary PC. When these computers "sleep", the Electric Sheep comes on and the 
computers communicate with each other by the Internet to share the work of 
creating morphing abstract animations known as "sheep".

FUSE (Filesystem in Userspace) is an interface for userspace programs
to export a filesystem to the Linux kernel.
The FUSE project consists of two components:
the fuse kernel module (maintained in the regular kernel repositories)
and the libfuse userspace library (contained in this package).
Libfuse provides the reference implementation for communicating with
the FUSE kernel module.

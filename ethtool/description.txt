Ethtool is the standard Linux utility for controlling network drivers
and hardware, particularly for wired Ethernet devices.

It can be used to:
* Get identification and diagnostic information
* Get extended device statistics
* Control speed, duplex, autonegotiation and flow control for Ethernet devices
* Control checksum offload and other hardware offload features
* Control DMA ring sizes and interrupt moderation
* Control receive queue selection for multiqueue devices

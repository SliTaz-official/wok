Nathive is a libre software image editor, similar to Adobe Photoshop, Corel 
Photo-Paint or GIMP, but focused on usability, logic and providing a smooth 
learning curve for everyone. The project runs in the GNOME desktop environment 
and anyone is welcome to collaborate on it with code, translations or ideas.

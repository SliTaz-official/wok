aubio is a tool designed for the extraction of annotations from audio signals.
Its features include segmenting a sound file before each of its attacks, 
performing pitch detection, tapping the beat and producing midi streams from 
live audio.

Because these tasks are difficult, we thought it was important to gather them 
in a dedicated library. To increase the fun, we have made these algorithms 
work in a causal way, so as to be used in real time applications with as low 
delay as possible. Functions can be used offline in sound editors and 
software samplers, or online in audio effects and virtual instruments.

aubio is written in C and is known to run on most modern architectures and
platforms.

aubio is a free and open source software released under the GNU/GPL license.

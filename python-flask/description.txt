Flask is a lightweight WSGI web application framework.
It is designed to make getting started quick and easy, with the ability
to scale up to complex applications.
It began as a simple wrapper around Werkzeug and Jinja and has become
one of the most popular Python web application frameworks.

Flask offers suggestions, but doesn't enforce any dependencies or project
layout. It is up to the developer to choose the tools and libraries they
want to use. There are many extensions provided by the community that make
adding new functionality easy.

libpanel - panel stack extension for curses

Panels are **curses** windows with the added feature of depth. Panel functions
allow the use of stacked windows and ensure the proper portions of each window
and the curses **stdscr** window are hidden or displayed when panels are added,
moved, modified or removed. The set of currently visible panels is the stack of
panels. The **stdscr** window is beneath all panels, and is not considered part
of the stack.

This class is the base class for all time zone objects.
A time zone is represented internally as a set of observances,
each of which describes the offset from GMT for a given time period.

Note that without the DateTime module, this module does not do much.
It's primary interface is through a DateTime object, and most users
will not need to directly use DateTime::TimeZone methods.

Iptables is the userspace command line program used to configure
the Linux 2.4.x and later packet filtering ruleset.
It is targeted towards system administrators.

Since Network Address Translation is also configured from the packet
filter ruleset, iptables is used for this, too.

The iptables package also includes ip6tables. ip6tables is used for
configuring the IPv6 packet filter.

This module is a Perl-only implementation of the cryptographic
cipher block chaining mode (CBC).
In combination with a block cipher such as AES or Blowfish,
you can encrypt and decrypt messages of arbitrarily long length.
The encrypted messages are compatible with the encryption format
used by the OpenSSL package.

To use this module, you will first create a Crypt::CBC cipher
object with new().
At the time of cipher creation, you specify an encryption key
to use and, optionally, a block encryption algorithm.
You will then call the start() method to initialize the encryption
or decryption process, crypt() to encrypt or decrypt one or more
blocks of data, and lastly finish(), to pad and encrypt the final
block.
For your convenience, you can call the encrypt() and decrypt()
methods to operate on a whole data value at once.

Rsync is a file transfer program for Unix systems.
Rsync uses the "rsync algorithm" which provides a very fast
method for bringing remote files into sync.
It does this by sending just the differences in the files
across the link, without requiring that both sets of files
are present at one of the ends of the link beforehand.

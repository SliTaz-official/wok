PyWebkitGtk provides python bindings around Webkit when it has been compiled
for GTK2.
PyWebkitGtk requires, and augments, PyGtk2.
Recent support has been added to PyWebKitGtk to provide full DOM access
manipulation, including javascript code execution and evaluation.

PyWebkitGtk comes with a demo application which is practically a fully-featured
web browser in its own right.
PyWebkitGtk is the basis for PyjamasDesktop, which provides a much easier-to-use
framework for application development than PyWebkitGtk on its own (it is fair to
say that whilst PyWebkitGtk is on the same level as PyGtk2, PyjamasDesktop is on
the same level as KiWi).

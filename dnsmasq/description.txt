Dnsmasq provides network infrastructure for small networks: DNS, DHCP,
router advertisement and network boot.
It is designed to be lightweight and have a small footprint, suitable
for resource constrained routers and firewalls.
It has also been widely used for tethering on smartphones and portable
hotspots, and to support virtual networking in virtualisation frameworks.
Supported platforms include Linux (with glibc and uclibc), Android, *BSD,
and Mac OS X.
Dnsmasq provides full IPv6 support.

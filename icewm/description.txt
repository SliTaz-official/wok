IceWM is a window manager for the X Window System.
The goal of IceWM is speed, simplicity, and not getting in the
user's way. It comes with a taskbar with pager, global and
per-window keybindings and a dynamic menu system.
Application windows can be managed by keyboard and mouse.
Windows can be iconified to the taskbar, to the tray, to the
desktop or be made hidden. They are controllable by a quick
switch window (Alt+Tab) and in a window list.
A handful of configurable focus models are menu-selectable.
Setups with multiple monitors are supported by RandR and Xinerama.
IceWM is very configurable, themeable and well documented.
It includes an optional external background wallpaper manager with
transparency support, a simple session manager and a system tray.

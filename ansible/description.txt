Ansible is a radically simple model-driven configuration management, 
multi-node deployment, and remote task execution system. Ansible works over 
SSH and does not require any software or daemons to be installed on remote 
nodes. Extension modules can be written in any language and are transferred 
to managed machines automatically.

This program currently can be used under Linux console, or terminal emulators 
with basic Unicode rendering support, like gnome-terminal, xterm, or PuTTY.

Simply run "bicon" to get a console supporting Arabic or Persian. The language 
used is chosen according to the LANG environment variable.

You can also choose the language country by specifying the country on the 
country on the command line, e.g ::

	bicon sa          # enables Arabic (Saudi Arabia) support
	bicon ir          # for Persian (Iran)

You can use the alt+shift combination to switch keyboard language.

Of course, you have a man page bicon(1) to check.

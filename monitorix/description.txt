Monitorix is a free, open source, lightweight system monitoring tool
designed to monitor as many services and system resources as possible.
It has been created to be used under production Linux/UNIX servers,
but due to its simplicity and small size can be used on embedded
devices as well.

It consists mainly of two programs: a collector, called monitorix,
which is a Perl daemon that is started automatically like any other
system service, and a CGI script called monitorix.cgi.
Monitorix includes its own HTTP server built in (which is listening
by default on port 8080/TCP) to see the statistics graphs, so you
aren't forced to install a third-party web server to use it.
Just point your browser at http://localhost:8080/monitorix.

All of its development was initially created for monitoring Red Hat,
Fedora and CentOS Linux systems, so this project was made keeping
in mind these type of distributions.
Today it runs on different GNU/Linux distributions and even in other
UNIX systems like FreeBSD, OpenBSD and NetBSD.

It is currently in active development adding new features, new graphs
and correcting bugs in the attempt to offer a great tool for daily
systems administration of any professional server.

Monitorix is an open source project and, just like any other open
source project, anyone can contribute with his own time and knowledge.

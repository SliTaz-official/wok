LFTP is a sophisticated file transfer program supporting a number
of network protocols (ftp, http, sftp, fish, torrent).
Like BASH, it has job control and uses the readline library for input.
It has bookmarks, a built-in mirror command, and can transfer several
files in parallel. It was designed with reliability in mind.

The FreeType engine is a free and portable font rendering engine, developed
to provide advanced font support for a variety of platforms and environments.
FreeType is a library which can open and manages font files as well as
efficiently load, hint and render individual glyphs. FreeType is not a font
server or a complete text-rendering library.
This version is compiled with the patented bytecode interpreter and subpixel
rendering enabled. It transparently overrides the system library using
ld.so.conf.d.

mod_perl is the marriage of Apache and Perl.

mod_perl brings together the full power of the Perl programming language and 
the Apache HTTP server. You can use Perl to manage Apache, respond to 
requests for web pages and much more.

mod_perl gives you a persistent Perl interpreter embedded in your web server. 
This lets you avoid the overhead of starting an external interpreter and 
avoids the penalty of Perl start-up time, giving you super-fast dynamic 
content.

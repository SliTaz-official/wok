Libconfig is a simple library for processing structured configuration
files, like this one.
This file format is more compact and more readable than XML.
And unlike XML, it is type-aware, so it is not necessary to do string
parsing in application code.

Libconfig is very compact - a fraction of the size of the expat XML
parser library. This makes it well-suited for memory-constrained systems.

The library includes bindings for both the C and C++ languages.
It works on POSIX-compliant UNIX and UNIX-like systems.

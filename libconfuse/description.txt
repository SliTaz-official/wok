LibConfuse is a configuration file parser library written in C.
It supports sections and (lists of) values, as well as other features
such as single and double quoted strings, environment variable expansion,
functions and nested include statements.
Values can be strings, integers, floats, booleans, and sections.

The goal is not to be *the* configuration file parser library with a
gazillion of features. Instead, it aims to be easy to use and quick to
integrate with your code.

vnStat is a console-based network traffic monitor for Linux and BSD that keeps
a log of network traffic for the selected interface(s). It uses the network
interface statistics provided by the kernel as information source. This means
that vnStat won't actually be sniffing any traffic and also ensures light use
of system resources.

Features:

  * quick and simple to install and get running
  * gathered statistics persists through system reboots
  * can monitor multiple interfaces at the same time
  * several output options
      * summary, hourly, daily, monthly, weekly, top 10 days
      * optional png image output (using libgd)
  * months can be configured to follow billing period
  * light, minimal resource usage
  * same low cpu usage regardless of traffic
  * can be used without root permissions

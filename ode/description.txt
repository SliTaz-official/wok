ODE is an open source, high performance library for simulating
rigid body dynamics.
It is fully featured, stable, mature and platform independent
with an easy to use C/C++ API.
It has advanced joint types and integrated collision detection
with friction.
ODE is useful for simulating vehicles, objects in virtual reality
environments and virtual creatures.
It is currently used in many computer games, 3D authoring tools
and simulation tools.

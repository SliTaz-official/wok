Digital photographs are not ideal. Of course, the better is your camera,
the better the results will be, but in any case if you look carefully at
shots taken even by the most expensive cameras equipped with the most
expensive lenses you will see various artifacts. It is very hard to make
ideal cameras, because there are a lot of factors that affect the final
image quality, and at some point camera and lens designers have to trade
one factor for another to achieve the optimal image quality, within the
given design restrictions and budget.

But we all want ideal shots, don't we? :) So that's what's Lensfun is all
about - rectifying the defects introduced by your photographic equipment.

Ogg is a multimedia container format, and the native file and stream
format for the Xiph.org multimedia codecs.

As with most container formats it encapsulates raw compressed data and
allows the interleaving of audio and video data inside a single convenient
format. Other examples of container formats are Quicktime .mov, the MPEG
program stream, and AVI.

In addition to encapsulation and interleave of multiple data streams,
Ogg provides packet framing, error detection, and periodic timestamps for
seeking, and in a small, bounded percentage bitrate overhead.

Ogg is a stream oriented container, meaning it can be written and read in
one pass, making it a natural fit for internet streaming and use in
processing pipelines. This stream orientation is the major design
difference over other file-based container formats.

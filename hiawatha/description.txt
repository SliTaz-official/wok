Hiawatha is an open source webserver with a focus on security.
I started Hiawatha in January 2002. Before that time, I had used
several webservers, but I didn't like them. They had unlogical,
almost cryptic configuration syntax and none of them gave me a
good feeling about their security and robustness. So, I decided
it was time to write my own webserver. I never thought that my
webserver would become what it is today, but I enjoyed working on
it and liked to have my own open source project.
In the years that followed, Hiawatha became a fully functional
webserver.

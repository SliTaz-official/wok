Winetricks is a helper script to download and install various redistributable
runtime libraries needed to run some programs in Wine.
These may include replacements for components of Wine using closed source
libraries.

Note: Although using winetricks may be very useful for getting some programs
      working in Wine, doing so may limit your ability to get support through
      WineHQ.

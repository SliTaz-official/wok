DirMngr - X.509 Directory Manager

DirMngr is a server for managing and downloading certificate revocation lists
(CRLs) for X.509 certificates and for downloading the certificates themselves.
Dirmngr also handles OCSP requests as an alternative to CRLs. Dirmngr is either
invoked internally by gpgsm (GnuPG-2) or when running as a system daemon
through the dirmngr-client tool.

Note that GnuPG includes an updated Dirmngr starting with GnuPG 2.1. Do not
expect that this standalone Dirmngr package will be maintained in the future.

Libxml2 is the XML C parser and toolkit developed for the Gnome project
(but usable outside of the Gnome platform), it is free software available
under the MIT License.
XML itself is a metalanguage to design markup languages, i.e. text language
where semantic and structure are added to the content using extra "markup"
information enclosed between angle brackets.
HTML is the most well-known markup language.
Though the library is written in C a variety of language bindings make it
available in other environments.

Libxml2 is known to be very portable, the library should build and work without
serious troubles on a variety of systems (Linux, Unix, Windows, CygWin, MacOS,
MacOS X, RISC Os, OS/2, VMS, QNX, MVS, VxWorks, ...)

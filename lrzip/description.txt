A compression utility that excels at compressing large files (usually > 10-50 MB).
Larger files or more free RAM means that the utility will be able to more
effectively compress your files (ie: faster and with smaller size), especially
if the filesize exceeds 100 MB.
You can either choose to optimise for speed (fast compression and decompression)
or size, but not both.

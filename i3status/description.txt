I3status is a small program for generating a status bar for i3bar,
dzen2, xmobar or similar programs.
It is designed to be very efficient by issuing a very small number
of system calls, as one generally wants to update such a status line
every second. This ensures that even under high load, your status
bar is updated correctly.
Also, it saves a bit of energy by not hogging your CPU as much as
spawning the corresponding amount of shell commands would.

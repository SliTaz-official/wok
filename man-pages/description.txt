This package contains Linux man pages for sections 2, 3, 4, 5, and 7.

Note that sometimes these pages are duplicates of pages also distributed in
other packages. This has been reported about dlclose.3, dlerror.3, dlopen.3,
dlsym.3 (found in ld.so), about resolver.3, resolv.conf.5 (found in
bind-utils), and about passwd.5, and mailaddr.7. Be careful not to overwrite
more up-to-date versions. Reports on further duplicates are welcome. Formerly
present and now removed duplicates: exports.5 (found in nfs-server-2.2*),
fstab.5, nfs.5 (found in util-linux-2.12*), lilo.8, lilo.conf.5 (found in
lilo-21.6*).

Copyrights: These man pages come under various copyrights. All pages are freely
distributable when the nroff source is included.

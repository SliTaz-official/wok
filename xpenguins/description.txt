XPenguins is a program for animating cute cartoons/animals in your
root window. By default it will be penguins - they fall from the top
of the screen, walk along the top of windows, up the side of windows
and do various other stuff. Other themes in the base package are "Big
Penguins" (50% bigger), "Classic Penguins" (reproducing XPenguins
version 1.2), "Turtles", and "Bill".  More themes in the xpenguins_themes
package: The Simpsons, Sonic the Hedgehog, Lemmings, Winnie the Pooh, and
Worms.

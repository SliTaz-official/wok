LXPanel is a GUI application for the Lightweight X11 Desktop Environment (LXDE).

It is derived from fbpanel and includes the following features:

  * User-friendly application menu automatically generated from .desktop files
    on the system.
  * Launcher bar (small icons clicked to launch apps).
  * Task bar supporting ICCCM/EWMH 'urgency' hint (Pidgin IM windows can flash
    on new incoming messages).
  * Run dialog (type a command to run, without opening a terminal).
  * Net status icon plug-in (optional).
  * Volume control plug-in (optional).
  * Notification area (system tray).
  * Digital clock.
  * Keyboard LEDs plug-in (display caps/num locks).
  * lxpanelctl: control lxpanel from other programs.

For example, `lxpanelctl run` will show the Run dialog in lxpanel, and
`lxpanelctl menu` will show the application menu. This is useful in combination
with window manager key bindings.

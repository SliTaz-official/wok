Locale::Maketext::Gettext joins the GNU gettext and Maketext frameworks.
It is a subclass of Locale::Maketext(3) that follows the way GNU gettext works.
It works seamlessly, both in the sense of GNU gettext and Maketext.
As a result, you enjoy both their advantages, and get rid of both their
problems, too.

You start as a usual GNU gettext localization project:
Work on PO files with the help of translators, reviewers and Emacs.
Turn them into MO files with msgfmt.
Copy them into the appropriate locale directory, such as
/usr/share/locale/de/LC_MESSAGES/myapp.mo.

Then, build your Maketext localization class, with your base class
changed from Locale::Maketext(3) to Locale::Maketext::Gettext.
That is all.

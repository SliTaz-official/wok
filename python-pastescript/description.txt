PasteScript is a pluggable command-line tool.

Note: Paste Script is being maintained on life support.
      That means that critical bugs will be fixed, and support for
      new versions of Python will be handled, but other than that
      new features are not being considered.

It includes some built-in features;

- Create file layouts for packages.
  For instance, paster create --template=basic_package MyPackage will
  create a setuptools-ready file layout.
- Serving up web applications, with configuration based on paste.deploy.

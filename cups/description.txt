OpenPrinting CUPS is the most current version of CUPS, a standards-based,
open source printing system for Linux速 and other Unix速-like operating
systems.

CUPS supports printing to:

* AirPrint速 and IPP Everywhere速 printers,
* Network and local (USB) printers with Printer Applications, and
* Network and local (USB) printers with (legacy) PPD-based printer drivers.

CUPS provides the System V ("lp") and Berkeley ("lpr") command-line
interfaces, a configurable web interface, a C API, and common print filters,
drivers, and backends for printing.
The cups-filters project provides additional filters and drivers.

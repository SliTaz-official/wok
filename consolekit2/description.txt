ConsoleKit2 is a framework for defining and tracking users, login
sessions, and seats.
It allows multiple users to be logged in at the same time and share
hardware for their graphical session.
ConsoleKit2 will keep track of those resources and whichever session
is active will have use of the hardware at that time.

OpenAL Soft is an LGPL-licensed, cross-platform, software
implementation of the OpenAL 3D audio API.
OpenAL provides capabilities for playing audio in a virtual
3D environment.
Distance attenuation, doppler shift, and directional sound
emitters are among the features handled by the API.
More advanced effects, including air absorption, occlusion,
and environmental reverb, are available through the EFX
extension.
It also facilitates streaming audio, multi-channel buffers,
and audio capture.

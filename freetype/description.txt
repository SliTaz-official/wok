FreeType is written in C. It is designed to be small, efficient, and highly
customizable while capable of producing high-quality output (glyph images) of
most vector and bitmap font formats for digital typography. FreeType is a freely
available and portable software library to render fonts.

Subpixel hinting mode can be chosen by setting the right value in your
environment, for example /etc/profile or ~/.profile

Available settings:

  * FT2_SUBPIXEL_HINTING=0  # Classic mode
  * FT2_SUBPIXEL_HINTING=1  # Infinality mode
  * FT2_SUBPIXEL_HINTING=2  # Default mode

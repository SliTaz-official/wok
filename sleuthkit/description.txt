The Sleuth KitÂ® (TSK) is a library and collection of command line tools
that allow you to investigate disk images.
The core functionality of TSK allows you to analyze volume and file system data.
The library can be incorporated into larger digital forensics tools and the
command line tools can be directly used to find evidence.

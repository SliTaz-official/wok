Rfkill is a small userspace tool to query the state of the rfkill switches,
buttons and subsystem interfaces.
Some devices come with a hard switch that lets you kill different types of
RF radios: 802.11, Bluetooth, NFC, UWB, WAN, WIMAX, FM.
Some times these buttons may kill more than one RF type.
The Linux kernel rfkill subsystem exposes these hardware buttons and lets
userspace query its status and set its status through a /dev/rfkill.
Given that at times some RF devices do not have hardware rfkill buttons
rfkill the Linux kernel also exposes software rfkill capabilities that
allows userspace to mimic a hardware rfkill event and turn on or off RF.

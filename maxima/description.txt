Maxima is a system for the manipulation of symbolic and numerical expressions, 
including differentiation, integration, Taylor series, Laplace transforms, 
ordinary differential equations, systems of linear equations, polynomials, and 
sets, lists, vectors, matrices, and tensors. Maxima yields high precision 
numeric results by using exact fractions, arbitrary precision integers, and 
variable precision floating point numbers. Maxima can plot functions and data in
two and three dimensions.

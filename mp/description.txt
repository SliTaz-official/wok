A text editor for programmers including the following features:

Fully scriptable using a C-like scripting language.
Unlimited undo levels.
Complete Unicode support.
Multiple files can be edited at the same time and blocks copied
  and pasted among them.
Syntax highlighting for many popular languages and file formats:
  C, C++, Perl, Shell Scripts, Ruby, Php, Python, HTML...
Creative use of tags: tags created by the external utility ctags
  are used to move instantaneously to functions or variables
  inside your current source tree. Tags are visually highlighted
  (underlined), and symbol completion can be triggered to avoid
  typing your own function names over and over.
Intelligent help system: pressing F1 over any word of a text
  being edited triggers the underlying system help (calling man
  when editing C or Shell files, perldoc with Perl, ri on Ruby...).
Understandable interface: drop-down menus, reasonable default
  key bindings.
Configurable keys, menus and colors.
Text templates can be easily defined and accessed.
Multiplatform: Unix/Linux ANSI and Curses, Qt4/Qt5, GTK+, KDE4,
  MS Windows (both windowed and console).
Automatic indentation, word wrapping, internal grep, learning and
  repeating functions.
Spellchecking support (via the ispell package).
Multilingual.
Password-protected, encrypted text files (using the ARCFOUR
  algorithm).
It helps you abandon vi, emacs and other six-legged freaks
  definitely.

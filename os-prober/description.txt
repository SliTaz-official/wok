Os-prober is a spinoff of debian-installer.
One of the installer's features is that it can probe disks
on the system for other operating systems, and add them to
the boot loader, so that installing Debian doesn't make
your other installed OS hard to boot.

To do this it needs to both be able to find out what version
of what OS lives in a given partition (linux, windows, dos,
macos, the hurd, solaris, qnx, minix).
It also needs to work out how to boot existing installed
linux systems, and has to be able to detect what distribution
is installed, to add a better menu entry to grub than just "linux".

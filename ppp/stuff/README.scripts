README.scripts - PPP scripts documentation for SliTaz GNU/Linux            2007
===============================================================================


The README.scripts file is based on the documentation found in the ppp source
package (version 2.4.4). The files in the scripts/ directory were contributed
by Al Longyear (longyear@netcom.com) and Adi Masputra (adi.masputra@sun.com).
This file was modified for SliTaz by Christophe Lincoln (pankso@slitaz.org).


ppp-on
------
This script will initiate a connection to the PPP system. It will run
the chat program with the connection script as a parameter. This is a
possible security hole. However, it is simple. It is meant to replace
the previous version of ppp-on which was not very functional.

The ppp-on script has entries for the account name, password, IP
addresses and telephone numbers. The parameters are passed to the
pppd process and then in turn to the second part of the connect
script as a set of environment variables.

Please make sure that you put the full path name to the ppp-on-dialer
script in the reference to it in ppp-on.


ppp-on-dialer
-------------
This is the second part to the simple calling script, ppp-on.  It
executes the chat program to connect the user with a standard UNIX
style getty/login connection sequence.


callback
--------
This script may be used in lieu of the ppp-on-dialer to permit the
common modem callback sequence. You may need to make changes to the
expected prompt string for the modem.

The script works by disabling the system's detection of the DCD
condition and working on the modem status message "NO CARRIER" which
is generated when the modem disconnects.

It is crude. It does work for my modem connection. Use as you see fit.


redialer
--------
The redialer script is a replacement for the ppp-on-dialer script.  It
will do 'attack dialing' or 'demon dialing' of one or more telephone
numbers. The first number which responds will be used for a
connection.

There is a limit of ten attempts and a 15 second delay between dialing
attempts. Both values are set in the script.


ppp-off
-------
This is a script which will terminate the active ppp connection. Use
as either "ppp-off" to terminate ppp0, or "ppp-off <device>" to
terminate the connection on <device>. For example, "ppp-off ppp2" will
terminate the ppp2 connection.

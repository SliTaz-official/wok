The Point-to-Point Protocol provides a standard way to transmit datagrams over a
serial link, as well as a standard way for the machines at either end of the
link to negotiate various optional characteristics of the link.

This package is most commonly used to manage a modem for dial-up or certain
kinds of broadband connections.

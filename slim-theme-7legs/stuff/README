I hope you already know him. This seven legged spider is a main hero of David
Thorne's humorous article. This article was reprinted on many websites. But
nevertheless, the original is here: http://www.27bslash6.com/overdue.html
Author of original artwork is David Thorne, certainly!
Image was outlined in the Inkscape, simplified and saved in vector format.

Panel was inspired by "flat" SLiM's theme panel.
It was outlined too, and semi-transparent gradients and shadow was adjusted
to have similar look.
